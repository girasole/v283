title: Neural Network-assisted Interval Reachability for Systems with Control Barrier
  Function-Based Safe Controllers
abstract: 'Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been widely utilized in the design
  of optimization-based controllers and filters for dynamical systems to ensure forward
  invariance of a given set of safe states. While CBF-based controllers offer safety
  guarantees, they can compromise the performance of the system, leading to undesirable
  behaviors such as unbounded trajectories and the emergence of locally stable spurious
  equilibria. Computing reachable sets for systems with CBF-based controllers is an
  effective approach for runtime performance and stability verification, and can potentially
  serve as a tool for trajectory re-planning. In this paper, we propose a computationally
  efficient interval reachability method for performance verification of systems with
  optimization-based controllers by: (i) approximating the optimization-based controller
  by a pre-trained neural network to avoid solving optimization problems repeatedly,
  and (ii) using mixed monotone theory to construct an embedding system that leverages
  state-of-the-art neural network verification algorithms for bounding the output
  of the neural network. Results in terms of the closeness of solutions of trajectories
  of the system with the optimization-based controller and the neural network are
  derived. Using a single trajectory of the embedding system along with our closeness
  of solutions result, we obtain an over-approximation of the reachable set of the
  system with optimization-based controllers. Numerical results are presented to corroborate
  the technical findings.'
