title: Diffusion Predictive Control with Constraints
abstract: Diffusion models have become popular for policy learning in robotics due
  to their ability to capture high-dimensional and multimodal distributions. However,
  diffusion policies are stochastic and typically trained offline, limiting their
  ability to handle unseen and dynamic conditions where novel constraints not represented
  in the training data must be satisfied. To overcome this limitation, we propose
  diffusion predictive control with constraints (DPCC), an algorithm for diffusion-based
  control with explicit state and action constraints that can deviate from those in
  the training data. DPCC incorporates model-based projections into the denoising
  process of a trained trajectory diffusion model and uses constraint tightening to
  account for model mismatch. This allows us to generate constraint-satisfying, dynamically
  feasible, and goal-reaching trajectories for predictive control. We show through
  simulations of a robot manipulator that DPCC outperforms existing methods in satisfying
  novel test-time constraints while maintaining performance on the learned control
  task.
