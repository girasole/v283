title: Informative Input Design for Dynamic Mode Decomposition
abstract: Efficiently estimating system dynamics from data is essential for minimizing
  data collection costs and improving model performance. This work addresses the challenge
  of designing future control inputs to maximize information gain, thereby improving
  the efficiency of the system identification process. We propose an approach that
  integrates informative input design into the Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control
  (DMDc) framework, which is well-suited for high-dimensional systems. By formulating
  an approximate convex optimization problem that minimizes the trace of the estimation
  error covariance matrix, we are able to efficiently reduce uncertainty in the model
  parameters while respecting constraints on the system states and control inputs.
  This method outperforms traditional techniques like Pseudo-Random Binary Sequences
  (PRBS) and orthogonal multisines, which do not adapt to the current system model.
  We validate our approach using aircraft and fluid dynamics simulations to demonstrate
  the practical applicability and effectiveness of our method. Our results show that
  strategically planning control inputs based on the current model enhances the accuracy
  of system identification while requiring less data. Furthermore, we provide our
  implementation and simulation interfaces as an open-source software package, facilitating
  further research development and use by industry practitioners.
