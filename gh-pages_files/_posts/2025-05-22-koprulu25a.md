title: 'Dense Dynamics-Aware Reward Synthesis: Integrating Prior Experience with Demonstrations'
abstract: Many continuous control problems can be formulated as sparse-reward reinforcement
  learning (RL) tasks. In principle, online RL methods can automatically explore the
  state space to solve each new task. However, discovering sequences of actions that
  lead to a non-zero reward becomes exponentially more difficult as the task horizon
  increases. Manually shaping rewards can accelerate learning for a fixed task, but
  it is an arduous process that must be repeated for each new environment. We introduce
  a systematic reward-shaping framework that distills the information contained in
  1) a task-agnostic prior data set and 2) a small number of task-specific expert
  demonstrations, and then uses these priors to synthesize dense dynamics-aware rewards
  for the given task. This supervision substantially accelerates learning in our experiments,
  and we provide analysis demonstrating how the approach can effectively guide online
  learning agents to faraway goals.
