title: "“What are my options?\"\x80\x9D: Explaining RL Agents with Diverse Near-Optimal
  Alternatives"
abstract: In this work, we present a new approach to explainable Reinforcement Learning
  called Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives (DNA). DNA seeks a set of reasonable "options"
  for trajectory-planning agents, optimizing policies to produce qualitatively diverse
  trajectories in Euclidean space. In the spirit of explainability, these distinct
  policies are used to "explain" an agent’s options in terms of available trajectory
  shapes from which a human user may choose. In particular, DNA applies to value function-based
  policies on Markov decision processes where agents are limited to continuous trajectories.
  Here, we describe DNA, which uses reward shaping in local, modified Q-learning problems
  to solve for distinct policies with guaranteed epsilon-optimality. We show that
  it successfully returns qualitatively different policies that constitute meaningfully
  different "options" in simulation, including a brief comparison to related approaches
  in the stochastic optimization field of Quality Diversity.
