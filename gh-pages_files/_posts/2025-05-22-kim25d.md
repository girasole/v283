title: 'CIKAN: Constraint Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Autonomous Spacecraft
  Rendezvous using Time Shift Governor'
abstract: This paper considers a Constraints-Informed Neural Network (CINN) approximation
  for the Time Shift Governor (TSG), which is an add-on scheme to the nominal closed-loop
  system used to enforce constraints by time-shifting the reference trajectory in
  spacecraft rendezvous applications. We incorporate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs),
  an emerging architecture in the AI community, as a fundamental component of CINN
  and propose a Constraints-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CIKAN)-based approximation
  for TSG. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the CIKAN-based TSG through simulations
  of constrained spacecraft rendezvous missions on highly elliptic orbits and present
  comparisons between CIKANs, MLP-based CINNs, and the conventional TSG.
