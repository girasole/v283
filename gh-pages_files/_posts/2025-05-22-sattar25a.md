title: Finite Sample Identification of Partially Observed Bilinear Dynamical Systems
abstract: We consider the problem of learning a realization of a partially observed
  bilinear dynamical system (BLDS) from noisy input-output data. Given a single trajectory
  of input-output samples, we provide an algorithm and a finite time analysis for
  learning the systemâ€™s Markov-like parameters, from which a balanced realization
  of the bilinear system can be obtained. The stability of BLDS depends on the sequence
  of inputs used to excite the system. Moreover, our identification algorithm regresses
  the outputs to highly correlated, nonlinear, and heavy-tailed covariates. These
  properties, unique to partially observed bilinear dynamical systems, pose significant
  challenges to the analysis of our algorithm for learning the unknown dynamics. We
  address these challenges and provide high probability error bounds on our identification
  algorithm under a uniform stability assumption. Our analysis provides insights into
  system theoretic quantities that affect learning accuracy and sample complexity.
  Lastly, we perform numerical experiments with synthetic data to reinforce these
  insights.
