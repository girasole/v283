title: Data-Driven and Stealthy Deactivation of Safety Filters
abstract: Safety filters ensure that control actions that are executed are always
  safe, no matter the controller in question. Previous work has proposed a simple
  and stealthy false-data injection attack for deactivating such safety filters. This
  attack injects false sensor measurements to bias state estimates toward the interior
  of a safety region, making the safety filter accept unsafe control actions. The
  attack does, however, require the adversary to know the dynamics of the system,
  the safety region used in the safety filter, and the observer gain. In this work
  we relax these requirements and show how a similar data-injection attack can be
  performed when the adversary only observes the input and output of the observer
  that is used by the safety filter, without any a priori knowledge about the system
  dynamics, safety region, or observer gain. In particular, the adversary uses the
  observed data to identify a state-space model that describes the observer dynamics,
  and then approximates a safety region in the identified embedding. We exemplify
  the data-driven attack on an inverted pendulum, where we show how the attack can
  make the system leave a safe set, even when a safety filter is supposed to stop
  this from happening.
