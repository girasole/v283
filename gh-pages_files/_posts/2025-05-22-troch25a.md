title: Action-Conditioned Hamiltonian Generative Networks (AC-HGN) for Supervised
  and Reinforcement Learning
abstract: This paper introduces Action-Conditioned Hamiltonian Generative Networks
  (AC-HGN), a physics-informed neural network architecture which learns Hamiltonian
  dynamics in environments subject to state-dependent external forces. AC-HGN embeds
  control inputs of any form into an abstract phase space, extending abstract Hamiltonian
  dynamics with learned external forces. In a supervised setting, results show that
  AC-HGN surpasses the prediction accuracy of state-of-the-art Lagrangian Neural Networks
  when trained on a static dataset. Furthermore, AC-HGN can be readily used as a physics-informed
  world model in a Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) setting by embedding
  policy actions as external forces. Due to the autoencoder structure of AC-HGN, this
  marks the first Physics-Informed MBRL algorithm which is not reliant on any domain
  knowledge and is not limited to specific input modalities. Experimental results
  demonstrate that AC-HGN achieves competitive sample efficiency and asymptotic performance
  in simple environments, with minimal degradation in more complex environments, while
  significantly outperforming an uninformed world model. We conclude that the proposed
  architecture can accurately and efficiently capture environment dynamics and external
  forces in a Hamiltonian fashion while requiring no domain-specific knowledge, improving
  the applicability of physics-informed neural networks in supervised and reinforcement
  learning settings.
