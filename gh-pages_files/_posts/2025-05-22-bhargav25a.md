title: Sensor Scheduling in Intrusion Detection Games with Uncertain Payoffs
abstract: We study the problem of sensor scheduling for an intrusion detection task.
  We model this as a 2-player zero-sum game over a graph, where the defender (Player
  1) seeks to identify the optimal strategy for scheduling sensor orientations to
  minimize the probability of missed detection at minimal cost, while the intruder
  (Player 2) aims to identify the optimal path selection strategy to maximize missed
  detection probability at minimal cost. The defender’s strategy space grows exponentially
  with the number of sensors, making direct computation of the Nash Equilibrium (NE)
  strategies computationally expensive. To tackle this, we propose a distributed variant
  of the Weighted Majority algorithm that exploits the structure of the game’s payoff
  matrix, enabling efficient computation of the NE strategies with provable convergence
  guarantees. Next, we consider a more challenging scenario where the defender lacks
  knowledge of the true sensor models and, consequently, the game’s payoff matrix.
  For this setting, we develop online learning algorithms that leverage bandit feedback
  from sensors to estimate the NE strategies. By building on existing results from
  perturbation theory and online learning in matrix games, we derive high-probability
  order-optimal regret bounds for our algorithms. Finally, through simulations, we
  demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed algorithms in both known and
  unknown payoff scenarios.
