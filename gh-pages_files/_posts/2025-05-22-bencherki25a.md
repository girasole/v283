title: Adaptive Control of Positive Systems with Application to Learning SSP
abstract: An adaptive controller is proposed and analyzed for the class of infinite-horizon
  optimal control problems in positive linear systems presented in (Ohlin et al.,
  2024b). This controller is derived from the solution of a “data-driven algebraic
  equation” constructed using the model-free Bellman equation from Q-learning. The
  equation is driven by data correlation matrices that do not scale with the number
  of data points, enabling efficient online implementation. Consequently, a sufficient
  condition guaranteeing stability and robustness to unmodeled dynamics is established.
  The derived results also provide a quantitative characterization of the interplay
  between excitation level and robustness to unmodeled dynamics. The class of optimal
  control problems considered here is equivalent to Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP)
  problems, allowing for a performance comparison between the proposed adaptive policy
  and model-free algorithms for learning the stochastic shortest path, as demonstrated
  in the numerical experiment.
