title: Neural Contraction Metrics with Formal Guarantees for Discrete-Time Nonlinear
  Dynamical Systems
abstract: Contraction metrics are crucial in control theory because they provide a
  powerful framework for analyzing stability, robustness, and convergence of various
  dynamical systems. However, identifying these metrics for complex nonlinear systems
  remains an open challenge due to the lack of scalable and effective tools. This
  paper explores the approach of learning verifiable contraction metrics parametrized
  as neural networks (NNs) for discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems. While prior
  works on formal verification of contraction metrics for general nonlinear systems
  have focused on convex optimization methods (e.g. linear matrix inequalities, etc)
  under the assumption of continuously differentiable dynamics, the growing prevalence
  of NN-based controllers, often utilizing ReLU activations, introduces challenges
  due to the non-smooth nature of the resulting closed-loop dynamics. To bridge this
  gap, we establish a new sufficient condition for establishing formal neural contraction
  metrics for general discrete-time nonlinear systems assuming only the continuity
  of the dynamics. We show that from a computational perspective, our sufficient condition
  can be efficiently verified using the state-of-the-art neural network verifier alpha-beta-CROWN,
  which scales up non-convex neural network verification via novel integration of
  symbolic linear bound propagation and branch-and-bound. Built upon our analysis
  tool, we further develop a learning method for synthesizing neural contraction metrics
  from sampled data. Finally, our approach is validated through the successful synthesis
  and verification of NN contraction metrics for various nonlinear examples.
