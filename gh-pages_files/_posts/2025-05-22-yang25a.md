title: 'STLGame: Signal Temporal Logic Games in Adversarial Multi-Agent Systems'
abstract: 'We study how to synthesize a robust and safe policy for autonomous systems
  under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks in adversarial settings against unknown
  dynamic agents. To ensure the worstcase STL satisfaction, we propose STLGame, a
  framework that models the multi-agent system as a two-player zero-sum game, where
  the ego agents try to maximize the STL satisfaction and other agents minimize it.
  STLGame aims to find a Nash equilibrium policy profile, which is the best case in
  terms of robustness against unseen opponent policies, by using the fictitious self-play
  (FSP) framework. FSP iteratively converges to a Nash profile, even in games set
  in continuous stateaction spaces. We propose a gradient-based method with differentiable
  STL formulas, which is crucial in continuous settings to approximate the best responses
  at each iteration of FSP. We show this key aspect experimentally by comparing with
  reinforcement learning-based methods to find the best response. Experiments on two
  standard dynamical system benchmarks, Ackermann steering vehicles and autonomous
  drones, demonstrate that our converged policy is almost unexploitable and robust
  to various unseen opponentsâ€™ policies. All code and additional experimental results
