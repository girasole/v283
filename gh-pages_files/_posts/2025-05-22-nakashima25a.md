title: Formation Shape Control using the Gromov-Wasserstein Metric
abstract: This article introduces a formation shape control algorithm, in the optimal
  control framework, for steering an initial population of agents to a desired configuration
  via employing the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. The underlying dynamical system is
  assumed to be a constrained linear system and the objective function is a sum of
  quadratic control-dependent stage cost and a Gromov-Wasserstein terminal cost. The
  inclusion of the Gromov-Wasserstein cost transforms the resulting optimal control
  problem into a well-known NP-hard problem, making it both numerically demanding
  and difficult to solve with high accuracy. Towards that end, we employ a recent
  semi-definite relaxation-driven technique to tackle the Gromov-Wasserstein distance.
  A numerical example is provided to illustrate our results.
