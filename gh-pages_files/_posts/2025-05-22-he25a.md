title: 'Imperative MPC: An End-to-End Self-Supervised Learning with Differentiable
  MPC for UAV Attitude Control'
abstract: Modeling and control of nonlinear dynamics are critical in robotics, especially
  in scenarios with unpredictable external influences and complex dynamics. Traditional
  cascaded modular control pipelines often yield suboptimal performance due to conservative
  assumptions and tedious parameter tuning. Pure data-driven approaches promise robust
  performance but suffer from low sample efficiency, sim-to-real gaps, and reliance
  on extensive datasets. Hybrid methods combining learning-based and traditional model-based
  control in an end-to-end manner offer a promising alternative. This work presents
  a self-supervised learning framework combining learning-based inertial odometry
  (IO) module and differentiable model predictive control (d-MPC) for Unmanned Aerial
  Vehicle (UAV) attitude control. The IO denoises raw IMU measurements and predicts
  UAV attitudes, which are then optimized by MPC for control actions in a bi-level
  optimization (BLO) setup, where the inner MPC optimizes control actions and the
  upper level minimizes discrepancy between real-world and predicted performance.
  The framework is thus end-to-end and can be trained in a self-supervised manner.
  This approach combines the strength of learning-based perception with the interpretable
  model-based control. Results show the effectiveness even under strong wind. It can
  simultaneously enhance both the MPC parameter learning and IMU prediction performance.
