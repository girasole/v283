title: 'LiveNet: Robust, Minimally Invasive Multi-Robot Control for Safe and Live
  Navigation in Constrained Environments'
abstract: Robots in densely populated real-world environments frequently encounter
  constrained and cluttered situations such as passing through narrow doorways, hallways,
  and corridor intersections, where conflicts over limited space result in collisions
  or deadlocks among the robots. Current decentralized state-of-the-art optimization-
  and neural network-based approaches (i) are predominantly designed for general open
  spaces, and (ii) are overly conservative, either guaranteeing safety, or liveness,
  but not both. While some solutions rely on centralized conflict resolution, their
  highly invasive trajectories make them impractical for real-world deployment. This
  paper introduces LiveNet, a fully decentralized and robust neural network controller
  that enables human-like yielding and passing, resulting in agile, non-conservative,
  deadlock-free, and safe, navigation in congested, conflict-prone spaces. LiveNet
  is minimally invasive, without requiring inter-agent communication or cooperative
  behavior. The key insight behind LiveNet is a unified CBF formulation for simultaneous
  safety and liveness, which we integrate within a neural network for robustness.
  We evaluated LiveNet in simulation and found that general multi-robot optimization-
  and learning-based navigation methods fail to even reach the goal, and while methods
  designed specially for such environments do succeed, they are 10–20$\times$ slower,
  4–5$\times$ more invasive, and much less robust to variations in the scenario configuration
  such as changes in the start states and goal states, among others. We open-source
  the LiveNet code at https://github.com/srikarg89/LiveNet.
