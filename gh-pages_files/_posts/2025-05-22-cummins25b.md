title: 'DeePC-Hunt: Data-enabled Predictive Control Hyperparameter Tuning via Differentiable
  Optimization'
abstract: This paper introduces Data-enabled Predictive Control Hyperparameter Tuning
  via Differentiable Optimization (DeePC-Hunt), a backpropagation-based method for
  automatic hyperparameter tuning of the DeePC algorithm. The necessity for such a
  method arises from the importance of hyperparameter selection to achieve satisfactory
  closed-loop DeePC performance. The standard methods for hyperparameter selection
  are to either optimize the open-loop performance, or use manual guess-and-check.
  Optimizing the open-loop performance can result in unacceptable closed-loop behavior,
  while manual guess-and-check can pose safety challenges. DeePC-Hunt provides an
  alternative method for hyperparameter tuning which uses an approximate model of
  the system dynamics and backpropagation to directly optimize hyperparameters for
  the closed-loop DeePC performance. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness
  of DeePC in combination with DeePC-Hunt in a complex stabilization task for a nonlinear
  system and its superiority over model-based control strategies in terms of robustness
  to model misspecifications.
