title: Flow matching for stochastic linear control systems
abstract: This paper addresses the problem of steering an initial probability distribution
  to a target probability distribution through a deterministic or stochastic linear
  control system. Our proposed approach is inspired by the flow matching methodology,
  with the difference that we can only affect the flow through the given control channels.
  The motivation for the problem comes from applications such as robotic swarms and
  stochastic thermodynamics, where the state of the system, modeled as a probability
  distribution, should be steered to a desired target configuration. The feedback
  control law that achieves the task is characterized as the conditional expectation
  of the control inputs for the stochastic bridges that respect the given control
  system dynamics. Explicit forms are derived for Gaussian and mixture of Gaussian
  settings, and a numerical procedure is presented to approximate the control law
  in the general setting.
