title: 'TamedPUMA: safe and stable imitation learning with geometric fabrics'
abstract: Using the language of dynamical systems, Imitation learning (IL) provides
  an intuitive and effective way of teaching stable task-space motions to robots with
  goal convergence. Yet, IL techniques are affected by serious limitations when it
  comes to ensuring safety and fulfillment of physical constraints. With this work,
  we solve this challenge via TamedPUMA, an IL algorithm augmented with a recent development
  in motion generation called geometric fabrics. As both the IL policy and geometric
  fabrics describe motions as artificial second-order dynamical systems, we propose
  two variations where IL provides a navigation policy for geometric fabrics. The
  result is a stable imitation learning strategy within which we can seamlessly blend
  geometrical constraints like collision avoidance and joint limits. Beyond providing
  a theoretical analysis, we demonstrate TamedPUMA with simulated and real-world tasks,
  including a 7-DoF manipulator.
