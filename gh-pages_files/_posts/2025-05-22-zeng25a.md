title: Data-driven optimal control of unknown nonlinear dynamical systems using the
  Koopman operator
abstract: Nonlinear optimal control is vital for numerous applications but remains
  challenging for unknown systems due to the difficulties in accurately modelling
  dynamics and handling computational demands, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
  This work develops a theoretically certifiable framework that integrates a modified
  Koopman operator approach with model-based reinforcement learning to address these
  challenges. By relaxing the requirements on observable functions, our method incorporates
  nonlinear terms involving both states and control inputs, significantly enhancing
  system identification accuracy. Moreover, by leveraging the power of neural networks
  to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), our approach is able to achieving
  stabilizing control for high-dimensional dynamical systems, up to 9-dimensional.
  The learned value function and control laws are proven to converge to those of the
  true system at each iteration. Additionally, the accumulated cost of the learned
  control closely approximates that of the true system, with errors ranging from $10^{-5}$
  to $10^{-3}$.
