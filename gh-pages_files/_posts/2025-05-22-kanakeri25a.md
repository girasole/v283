title: Outlier-Robust Linear System Identification Under Heavy-Tailed Noise
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the state transition matrix of a linear
  time-invariant (LTI) system, given access to multiple independent trajectories sampled
  from the system. Several recent papers have conducted a non-asymptotic analysis
  of this problem, relying crucially on the assumption that the process noise is either
  Gaussian or sub-Gaussian, i.e., "light-tailed". In sharp contrast, we work under
  a significantly weaker noise model, assuming nothing more than the existence of
  the fourth moment of the noise distribution. For this setting, we provide the first
  set of results demonstrating that one can obtain sample-complexity bounds for linear
  system identification that are nearly of the same order as under sub-Gaussian noise.
  To achieve such results, we develop a novel robust system identification algorithm
  that relies on constructing multiple weakly-concentrated estimators, and then boosting
  their performance using suitable tools from high-dimensional robust statistics.
  Interestingly, our analysis reveals how the kurtosis of the noise distribution,
  a measure of heavy-tailedness, affects the number of trajectories needed to achieve
  desired estimation error bounds. Finally, we show that our algorithm and analysis
  technique can be easily extended to account for scenarios where an adversary can
  arbitrarily corrupt a small fraction of the collected trajectory data. Our work
  takes the first steps towards building a robust statistical learning theory for
  control under non-ideal assumptions on the data-generating process.
