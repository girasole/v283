title: Stochastic Real-Time Deception in Nash Equilibrium Seeking for Games with Quadratic
  Payoffs
abstract: In multi-agent autonomous systems, deception is a fundamental concept which
  characterizes the exploitation of unbalanced information to mislead victims into
  choosing oblivious actions. This effectively alters the system’s long term behavior,
  leading to outcomes that may be beneficial to the deceiver but detrimental to victim.
  We study this phenomenon for a class of model-free Nash equilibrium seeking (NES)
  where players implement independent stochastic exploration signals to learn the
  pseudogradient flow. In particular, we show that deceptive players who obtain real-
  time measurements of other players’ stochastic perturbation can incorporate this
  information into their own NES action update, consequentially steering the overall
  dynamics to a new operating point that could potentially improve the payoffs of
  the deceptive players. We consider games with quadratic payoff functions, as this
  restriction allows us to derive a more explicit formulation of the capabilities
  of the deceptive players. By leveraging results on multi-input stochastic averaging
  for dynamical systems, we establish local exponential (in probability) convergence
  for the proposed deceptive NES dynamics. To illustrate our results, we apply them
  to a two player quadratic game.
