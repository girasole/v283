title: 'Bridging Distributionally Robust Learning and Offline RL: An Approach to Mitigate
  Distribution Shift and Partial Data Coverage'
abstract: The goal of an offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is to learn
  the optimal policy using offline data, without access to the environment for online
  exploration. One of the main challenges in offline RL is the distribution shift
  which refers to the difference between the state-action visitation distribution
  of the data generating policy and the learning policy. Many recent works have used
  the idea of pessimism for developing offline RL algorithms and characterizing their
  sample complexity under a relatively weak assumption of single policy concentrability.
  Different from the offline RL literature, the area of distributionally robust learning
  (DRL) offers a principled framework that uses a minimax formulation to tackle model
  mismatch between training and testing environments. In this work, we aim to bridge
  these two areas by showing that the DRL approach can tackle the distributional shift
  problem in offline RL. In particular, we propose two offline RL algorithms using
  the DRL framework, for the tabular and linear function approximation settings, and
  characterize their sample complexity under the single policy concentrability assumption.
  We also demonstrate the performance of our algorithm through simulation experiments
  and by comparing it with other state-of-the-art tabular offline RL algorithms.
