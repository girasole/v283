title: Learning Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Activation Functions by Infinite-Dimensional
  Optimization
abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold
  Networks (KAN) have recently reshaped the landscape of functional representation
  in the context of training univariate activation functions, thus achieving remarkable
  performance gains over traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPs). However, the parametrization
  of the activation functions in KANs hinders their scalability and usage in machine-learning
  applications. In this article, we propose a novel infinite-dimensional optimization
  framework to learn the activation functions. Our game-changing approach enables
  the achievement of boundedness, interpretability, and, seamless compatibility with
  training by backpropagation are all preserved for the network, while also significantly
  reducing the number of parameters required to represent each edge. Through functional
  representation examples, our results reveal superior accuracy in tasks such as functional
  representation, positioning our method as a transformative leap forward in neural
  network design and optimization.
