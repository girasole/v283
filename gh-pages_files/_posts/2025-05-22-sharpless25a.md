title: Linear Supervision for Nonlinear, High-Dimensional Neural Control and Differential
  Games
abstract: As the dimension of a system increases, traditional methods for control
  and differential games rapidly become intractable, making the design of safe autonomous
  agents challenging in complex or team settings. Deep-learning approaches avoid discretization
  and yield numerous successes in robotics and autonomy, but at a higher dimensional
  limit, accuracy falls as sampling becomes less efficient. We propose using rapidly
  generated \textit{linear} solutions to the partial differential equation (PDE) arising
  in the problem to accelerate and improve learned value functions for guidance in
  high-dimensional, \textit{nonlinear} problems. We define two programs that combine
  supervision of the linear solution with a standard PDE loss. We demonstrate that
  these programs offer improvements in speed and accuracy in both a 50-D differential
  game problem and a 10-D quadrotor control problem.
