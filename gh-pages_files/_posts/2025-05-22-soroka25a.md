title: Learning Temporal Logic Predicates from Data with Statistical Guarantees
abstract: Temporal logic rules are often used in control and robotics to provide structured,
  human-interpretable descriptions of trajectory data. These rules have numerous applications
  including safety validation using formal methods, constraining motion planning among
  autonomous agents, and classifying data. However, existing methods for learning
  temporal logic predicates from data do not provide assurances about the correctness
  of the resulting predicate. We present a novel method to learn temporal logic predicates
  from data with finite-sample correctness guarantees. Our approach leverages expression
  optimization and conformal prediction to learn predicates that correctly describe
  future trajectories under mild statistical assumptions. We provide experimental
  results showing the performance of our approach on a simulated trajectory dataset
  and perform ablation studies to understand how each component of our algorithm contributes
  to its performance.
