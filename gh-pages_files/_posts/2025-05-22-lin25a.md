title: Probabilistic Satisfaction of Temporal Logic Constraints in Reinforcement Learning
  via Adaptive Policy-Switching
abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a subset of machine learning
  that introduces constraints into the traditional reinforcement learning (RL) framework.
  Unlike conventional RL which aims solely to maximize cumulative rewards, CRL incorporates
  additional constraints that represent specific mission requirements or limitations
  that the agent must comply with during the learning process. In this paper, we address
  a type of CRL problem where an agent aims to learn the optimal policy to maximize
  reward while ensuring a desired level of temporal logic constraint satisfaction
  throughout the learning process. We propose a novel framework that relies on switching
  between pure learning (reward maximization) and constraint satisfaction. This framework
  estimates the probability of constraint satisfaction based on earlier trials and
  properly adjusts the probability of switching between learning and constraint satisfaction
  policies. We theoretically validate the correctness of the proposed algorithm and
  demonstrate its performance through comprehensive simulations.
