title: Learning Feasible Transitions for Efficient Contact Planning
abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient contact planner for quadrupedal robots
  to navigate in extremely constrained environments such as stepping stones. The main
  difficulty in this setting stems from the mixed nature of the problem, namely discrete
  search over the steppable patches and continuous trajectory optimization. To speed
  up the discrete search, we study the properties of the transitions from one contact
  mode to another. In particular, we propose to learn a dynamic feasibility classifier
  and a target adjustment network. The former predicts if a contact transition between
  two contact modes is dynamically feasible. The latter is trained to compensate for
  misalignment in reaching a desired set of contact locations, due to imperfections
  of the low-level control. We integrate these learned networks in a Monte Carlo Tree
  Search (MCTS) contact planner. Our simulation results demonstrate that training
  these networks with offline data significantly speeds up the online search process
  and improves its accuracy.
