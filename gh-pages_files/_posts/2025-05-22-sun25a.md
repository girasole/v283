title: 'Learn With Imagination: Safe Set Guided State-wise Constrained Policy Optimization'
abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) excels in various control tasks, yet the
  absence of safety guarantees hampers its real-world applicability. In particular,
  explorations during learning usually results in safety violations, while the RL
  agent learns from those mistakes. On the other hand, safe control techniques ensure
  persistent safety satisfaction but demand strong priors on system dynamics, which
  is usually hard to obtain in practice. To address these problems, we present Safe
  Set Guided State-wise Constrained Policy Optimization (S-3PO), a pioneering algorithm
  generating state-wise safe optimal policies with zero training violations, i.e.,
  learning without mistakes. S-3PO first employs a safety-oriented monitor with black-box
  dynamics to ensure safe exploration. It then enforces an "imaginary" cost for the
  RL agent to converge to optimal behaviors within safety constraints. S-3PO outperforms
  existing methods in high-dimensional robotics tasks, managing state-wise constraints
  with zero training violation. This innovation marks a significant stride towards
  real-world safe RL deployment.
