title: 'Deep Source-Seekers with Obstacle Avoidance: Adaptive Hybrid Control with
  Transformers In-The-Loop'
abstract: 'Autonomous signal source localization is a cornerstone of modern robotics,
  underpinning critical applications in environmental monitoring, search and rescue,
  and industrial automation. Traditional source-seeking methods, such as gradient-based
  algorithms and potential field-based approaches, often struggle with local minimum
  entrapment in environments cluttered with obstacles. To address these challenges,
  in this paper we introduce a novel model-free approach that combines a perception-driven
  hybrid controller—integrating adaptive continuous-time and discrete-time feedback—with
  an Environmental Complexity Adapter (ECA) for perception model selection. The proposed
  dynamics implement real-time exploration/exploitation mechanisms and complementary
  deep learning-based perception architectures: YOLOv10 for rapid and accurate object
  detection in clear conditions, and Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR) for
  enhanced robustness in noisy environments. By continuously assessing the quality
  of sensor data, the ECA dynamically switches between these models, optimizing the
  trade-off between processing speed and detection reliability. This approach harnesses
  the robustness of hybrid controllers while enabling efficient, perception-guided
  source-seeking and obstacle avoidance in complex environments. Extensive numerical
  simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.'
