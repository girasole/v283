title: Domain Randomization is Sample Efficient for Linear Quadratic Control
abstract: We study the sample efficiency of domain randomization and robust control
  for the benchmark problem of learning the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Domain
  randomization, which synthesizes controllers by minimizing average performance over
  a distribution of model parameters, has achieved empirical success in robotics,
  but its theoretical properties remain poorly understood. We establish that with
  an appropriately chosen sampling distribution, domain randomization achieves the
  optimal asymptotic rate of decay in the excess cost, matching certainty equivalence.
  We further demonstrate that robust control, while potentially overly conservative,
  exhibits superior performance in the low-data regime due to its ability to stabilize
  uncertain systems with coarse parameter estimates. We propose a gradient-based algorithm
  for domain randomization that performs well in numerical experiments, which enables
  us to validate the trends predicted by our analysis. These results provide insights
  into the use of domain randomization in learning-enabled control, and highlight
  several open questions about its application to broader classes of systems.
