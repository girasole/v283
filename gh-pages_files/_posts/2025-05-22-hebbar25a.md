title: 'Responding to Promises: No-regret learning against followers with memory'
abstract: We consider a repeated Stackelberg game setup where the leader faces a sequence
  of followers of unknown types and must learn what commitments to make. While previous
  works have considered followers that best respond to the commitment announced by
  the leader in every round, we relax this setup in two ways. Motivated by natural
  scenarios where the leader’s reputation factors into how the followers choose their
  response, we consider followers with memory. Specifically, we model followers that
  base their response on not just the leader’s current commitment but on an aggregate
  of their past commitments. In developing learning strategies that the leader can
  employ against such followers, we make the second relaxation and assume boundedly
  rational followers – in particular – quantal responding followers. Interestingly,
  we observe that the smoothness property offered by the quantal response (QR) model
  helps in addressing the challenge posed by learning against followers with memory.
  Utilizing techniques from online learning, we develop algorithms that guarantee
  $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret for quantal responding memory-less followers and $O(\sqrt{BT})$
  regret for followers with bounded memory of length $B$ with both scaling polynomially
  in game parameters.
