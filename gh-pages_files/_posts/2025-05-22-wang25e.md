title: Federated Posterior Sharing for Multi-Agent Systems in Uncertain Environments
abstract: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) agents is increasingly growing in
  complex, dynamic environments such as disaster response, search and rescue, and
  law enforcement. These domains are often only partially known, requiring agents
  to learn and adapt as they gather more information. In multi-agent settings, where
  agents operate independently and possess diverse, partial views of the environment,
  sharing their environmental knowledge is essential for enhancing operational efficiency
  and safety. Existing federated learning approaches focus primarily on policy sharing
  without modeling environmental uncertainty. To address this gap, this paper presents
  a framework that enables multiple agents to collaboratively share their probabilistic
  knowledge of the environment, building a global, shared understanding that efficiently
  guides their policies. Unlike existing data fusion techniques that exchange raw
  data–posing privacy risks and increasing communication costs–our method fuses agents’
  local posterior distributions as an abstract representation of their past data.
  We provide both single-step and multi-step synchronization, enabling recursive aggregation
  of agents’ knowledge to support informed and adaptive decision-making. Numerical
  experiments show that our method achieves superior accuracy and decision efficiency
  compared to several existing methods, particularly in settings with heterogeneous
  priors and greater uncertainty.
