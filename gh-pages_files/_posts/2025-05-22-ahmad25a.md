title: Accelerating Proximal Policy Optimization Learning Using Task Prediction for
  Solving Environments with Delayed Rewards
abstract: 'In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of delayed rewards in
  reinforcement learning (RL). While Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has emerged
  as a leading Policy Gradient method, its performance can degrade under delayed rewards.
  We introduce two key enhancements to PPO: a hybrid policy architecture that combines
  an offline policy (trained on expert demonstrations) with an online PPO policy,
  and a reward shaping mechanism using Time Window Temporal Logic (TWTL). The hybrid
  architecture leverages offline data throughout training while maintaining PPOâ€™s
  theoretical guarantees. Building on the monotonic improvement framework of Trust
  Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), we prove that our approach ensures improvement
  over both the offline policy and previous iterations, with a bounded performance
  gap of $(2\varsigma\gamma\alpha^2)/(1-\gamma)^2$, where $\alpha$ is the mixing parameter,
  $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $\varsigma$ bounds the expected advantage.
  Additionally, we prove that our TWTL-based reward shaping preserves the optimal
  policy of the original problem. TWTL enables formal translation of temporal objectives
  into immediate feedback signals that guide learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our approach through extensive experiments on an inverted pendulum and a lunar
  lander environments, showing improvements in both learning speed and final performance
  compared to standard PPO and offline-only approaches.'
