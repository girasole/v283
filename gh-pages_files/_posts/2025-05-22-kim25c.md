title: Realizable Continuous-Space Shields for Safe Reinforcement Learning
abstract: While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success
  across various domains, it remains vulnerable to occasional catastrophic failures
  without additional safeguards. An effective solution to prevent these failures is
  to use a shield that validates and adjusts the agent’s actions to ensure compliance
  with a provided set of safety specifications. For real-world robotic domains, it
  is essential to define safety specifications over continuous state and action spaces
  to accurately account for system dynamics and compute new actions that minimally
  deviate from the agent’s original decision. In this paper, we present the first
  shielding approach specifically designed to ensure the satisfaction of safety requirements
  in continuous state and action spaces, making it suitable for practical robotic
  applications. Our method builds upon realizability, an essential property that confirms
  the shield will always be able to generate a safe action for any state in the environment.
  We formally prove that realizability can be verified for stateful shields, enabling
  the incorporation of non-Markovian safety requirements, such as loop avoidance.
  Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in ensuring safety without
  compromising the policy’s success rate by applying it to a navigation problem and
  a multi-agent particle environment.
