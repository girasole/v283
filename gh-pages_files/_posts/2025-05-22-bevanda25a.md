title: 'Kernel-Based Optimal Control: An Infinitesimal Generator Approach'
abstract: This paper presents a novel operator-theoretic approach for optimal control
  of nonlinear stochastic systems within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our learning
  framework leverages data samples of system dynamics and stage cost functions, with
  only control penalties and constraints provided. The proposed method directly learns
  the infinitesimal generator of a controlled stochastic diffusion in an infinite-dimensional
  hypothesis space. We demonstrate that our approach seamlessly integrates with modern
  convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions, enabling a data-driven
  solution to the optimal control problems. Furthermore, our learning framework includes
  nonparametric estimators for uncontrolled infinitesimal generators as a special
  case. Numerical experiments, ranging from synthetic differential equations to simulated
  robotic systems, showcase the advantages of our approach compared to both modern
  data-driven and classical nonlinear programming methods for optimal control.
