title: Asymptotics of Linear Regression with Linearly Dependent Data
abstract: In this paper we study the asymptotics of linear regression in settings
  where the covariates exhibit a linear dependency structure, departing from the standard
  assumption of independence. We model the covariates as a non-Gaussian stochastic
  process with spatio-temporal covariance and analyze the performance of ridge regression
  in the high-dimensional proportional regime, where the number of samples and feature
  dimensions grow proportionally. A Gaussian universality theorem is proven, demonstrating
  that the asymptotics are invariant under replacing the non-Gaussian covariates with
  Gaussian vectors preserving mean and covariance, for which tools from random matrix
  theory can be used to derive precise characterizations of the estimation error.
  The estimation error is characterized by a fixed-point equation involving the spectral
  properties of the spatio-temporal covariance matrices, enabling efficient computation.
  We then study optimal regularization, overparameterization, and the double descent
  phenomenon in the context of dependent data. Simulations validate our theoretical
  predictions, shedding light on how dependencies influence estimation error and the
  choice of regularization parameters.
