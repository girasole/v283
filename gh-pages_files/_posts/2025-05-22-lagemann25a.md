title: 'HydroGym: A Reinforcement Learning Platform for Fluid Dynamics'
abstract: The modeling and control of fluid flows remain a significant challenge with
  tremendous potential to advance fields including transportation, energy, and medicine.
  Effective fluid flow control can lead to drag reduction, enhanced mixing, and noise
  reduction, among other applications. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
  great success in complex domains, such as robotics and protein folding, its application
  to flow control is hindered by the lack of standardized platforms and the computational
  demands of fluid simulations. To address these challenges, we introduce HydroGym,
  a solver-independent RL platform for flow control research. HydroGym integrates
  sophisticated flow control benchmarks, a scalable runtime, and state-of-the-art
  RL algorithms. Our platform includes four validated non-differentiable fluid flow
  environments and one differentiable environment, all evaluated with a variety of
  modern RL algorithms. HydroGymâ€™s scalable design allows computations to run seamlessly
  from laptops to high-performance computing resources, providing a standardized interface
  for implementing new flow environments. HydroGym aims to bridge the gap in flow
  control research, providing a robust platform to support both non-differentiable
  and differentiable RL techniques, fostering advancements in scientific machine learning.
