title: 'PACE: A Framework for Learning and Control in Linear Incomplete-Information
  Differential Games'
abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of a two-player linear quadratic differential
  game with incomplete information, a scenario commonly encountered in multi-agent
  control, human-robot interaction (HRI), and approximation methods to solve general-sum
  differential games. While solutions to such linear differential games are typically
  obtained through coupled Riccati equations, the complexity increases when agents
  have incomplete information, particularly when neither is aware of the other’s cost
  function. To tackle this challenge, we propose a model-based Peer-Aware Cost Estimation
  (PACE) framework for learning the cost parameters of the other agent. In PACE, each
  agent treats its peer as a learning agent rather than a stationary optimal agent,
  models their learning dynamics, and leverages this dynamic to infer the cost function
  parameters of the other agent. This approach enables agents to infer each other’s
  objective function in real time based solely on their previous state observations
  and dynamically adapt their control policies. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical
  guarantee for the convergence of parameter estimation and the stability of system
  states in PACE. Additionally, using numerical studies, we demonstrate how modeling
  the learning dynamics of the other agent benefits PACE, compared to approaches that
  approximate the other agent as having complete information, particularly in terms
  of stability and convergence speed.
