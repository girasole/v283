title: Neuro-Symbolic Deadlock Resolution in Multi-Robot Systems
abstract: This work addresses the problem of deadlock situations that are common in
  decentralized multi-robot missions. Existing approaches focus on predicting potential
  deadlocks and intervening before they actually occur. However, these methods often
  struggle to detect all possible deadlocks, especially in environments with uncontrollable
  obstacles, and may inevitably introduce new dead-locks after interventions. Consequently,
  we propose a neuro-symbolic deadlock resolution (NSDR) method based on Neural Logic
  Machines (NLMs). NSDR is designed specifically to resolve dead-locks after their
  occurrence, with the guarantee that no further persistent deadlocks will emerge
  after the initial resolution in environments with or without obstacles. Our approach
  leverages the similarity in logic rules when resolving simple deadlocks involving
  a small number of robots; this facilitates their use when resolving more complex
  scenarios with larger robot groups. Training NSDR on simpler deadlock cases allows
  it to generalize and effectively resolve more complex situations by utilizing the
  logic rules it has learned from simple deadlocks. We thoroughly evaluate the method
  in case studies with varying numbers of robots involved in deadlocks and show that
  NSDR outperforms the state of the art methods, which are based on the use of the
  adaptive repulsive force.
