title: Learning Collective Dynamics of Multi-Agent Systems using Event-based Vision
abstract: 'This paper proposes a novel problem: vision-based perception to learn and
  predict the collective dynamics of multi-agent systems, specifically focusing on
  interaction strength and convergence time. Multi-agent systems are defined as collections
  of more than ten interacting agents that exhibit complex group behaviors. Unlike
  prior studies that assume knowledge of agent states, we focus on deep learning models
  to directly predict collective dynamics from visual data, captured as frames or
  events. Due to the lack of relevant datasets, we create a simulated dataset using
  a state-of-the-art flocking simulator, coupled with a vision-to-event conversion
  framework. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of event-based representation
  over traditional frame-based methods in predicting these collective behaviors. Based
  on our analysis, we present event-based vision for Multi-Agent dynamic Prediction
  (evMAP), a deep learning architecture designed for real-time, accurate understanding
  of interaction strength and collective behavior emergence in multi-agent systems.'
