title: Physics-informed Gaussian Processes as Linear Model Predictive Controller
abstract: We introduce a novel algorithm for controlling linear time invariant systems
  in a tracking problem. The controller is based on a Gaussian Process (GP) whose
  realizations satisfy a system of linear ordinary differential equations with constant
  coefficients. Control inputs for tracking are determined by conditioning the prior
  GP on the setpoints, i.e. control as inference. The resulting Model Predictive Control
  scheme incorporates pointwise soft constraints by introducing virtual setpoints
  to the posterior Gaussian process. We show theoretically that our controller satisfies
  open-loop stability for the optimal control problem by leveraging general results
  from Bayesian inference and demonstrate this result in a numerical example.
