title: Finite Sample Analysis of Tensor Decomposition for Learning Mixtures of Linear
  Systems
abstract: We study the problem of learning mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS)
  from input-output data. The mixture setting allows us to leverage observations from
  related dynamical systems to improve the estimation of individual models. Building
  on spectral methods for mixtures of linear regressions, we propose a moment-based
  estimator that uses tensor decomposition to estimate the impulse response parameters
  of the mixture models. The estimator improves upon existing tensor decomposition
  approaches for MLDS by utilizing the entire length of the observed trajectories.
  We provide sample complexity bounds for estimating MLDS in the presence of noise,
  in terms of both the number of trajectories $N$ and the trajectory length $T$, and
  demonstrate the performance of the estimator through simulations.
