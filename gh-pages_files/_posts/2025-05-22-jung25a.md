title: Contingency Constrained Planning with MPPI within MPPI
abstract: For safety, autonomous systems must be able to consider sudden changes and
  enact contingency plans appropriately. State-of-the-art methods currently find trajectories
  that balance between nominal and contingency behavior, or plan for a singular contingency
  plan; however, this does not guarantee that the resulting plan is safe for all time.
  To address this research gap, this paper presents Contingency-MPPI, a data-driven
  optimization-based strategy that embeds contingency planning inside a nominal planner.
  By learning to approximate the optimal contingency-constrained control sequence
  with adaptive importance sampling, the proposed methodâ€™s sampling efficiency is
  further improved with initializations from a lightweight path planner and trajectory
  optimizer. Finally, we present simulated and hardware experiments demonstrating
  our algorithm generating nominal and contingency plans in real time on a mobile
  robot.
