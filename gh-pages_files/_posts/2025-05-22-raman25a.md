title: The Complexity of Sequential Prediction in Dynamical Systems
abstract: We study the problem of learning to predict the next state of a dynamical
  system when the underlying evolution function is unknown. Unlike previous work,
  we place no parametric assumptions on the dynamical system, and study the problem
  from a learning theory perspective. We define new combinatorial measures and dimensions
  and show that they quantify the optimal mistake and regret bounds in the realizable
  and agnostic settings respectively. By doing so, we find that in the realizable
  setting, the total number of mistakes can grow according to \emph{any} increasing
  function of the time horizon $T$. In contrast, we show that in the agnostic setting
  under the commonly studied notion of Markovian regret, the only possible rates are
  $\Theta(T)$ and $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T})$.
