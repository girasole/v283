title: Logarithmic Regret for Nonlinear Control
abstract: We address the problem of learning to control an unknown nonlinear dynamical
  system through sequential interactions. Motivated by high-stakes applications in
  which mistakes can be catastrophic, such as robotics and healthcare, we study situations
  where it is possible for fast sequential learning to occur. Fast sequential learning
  is characterized by the ability of the learning agent to incur logarithmic regret
  relative to a fully-informed baseline. We demonstrate that fast sequential learning
  is achievable in a diverse class of continuous control problems where the system
  dynamics depend smoothly on unknown parameters, provided the optimal control policy
  is persistently exciting. Additionally, we derive a regret bound which grows with
  the square root of the number of interactions for cases where the optimal policy
  is not persistently exciting. Our results provide the first regret bounds for controlling
  nonlinear dynamical systems depending nonlinearly on unknown parameters. We validate
  the trends our theory predicts in simulation on a simple dynamical system.
