title: Robust Control of Uncertain Switched Affine Systems via Scenario Optimization
abstract: Switched affine systems are often used to model and control complex dynamical
  systems that operate in multiple modes. However, uncertainties in the system matrices
  can challenge their stability and performance. This paper introduces a new approach
  for designing switching control laws for uncertain switched affine systems using
  data-driven scenario optimization. Instead of relaxing invariant sets, our method
  creates smaller invariant sets with quadratic Lyapunov functions through scenario-based
  optimization, effectively reducing chattering effects and regulation error. The
  framework ensures robustness against parameter uncertainties while improving accuracy.
  We validate our method with applications in multi-objective interval Markov decision
  processes and power electronic converters, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness.
