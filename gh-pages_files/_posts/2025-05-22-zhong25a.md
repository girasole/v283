title: 'Bridging Adaptivity and Safety: Learning Agile Collision-Free Locomotion Across
  Varied Physics'
abstract: 'Real-world legged locomotion systems often need to reconcile agility and
  safety for different scenarios. Moreover, the underlying dynamics are often unknown
  and time-variant (e.g., payload, friction). In this paper, we introduce BAS (Bridging
  Adaptivity and Safety), which builds upon the pipeline of prior work Agile But Safe
  (ABS) and is designed to provide adaptive safety even in dynamic environments with
  uncertainties. BAS involves an agile policy to avoid obstacles rapidly and a recovery
  policy to prevent collisions, a physical parameter estimator that is concurrently
  trained with agile policy, and a learned control-theoretic RA (reach-avoid) value
  network that governs the policy switch. Also, the agile policy and RA network are
  both conditioned on physical parameters to make them adaptive. To mitigate the distribution
  shift issue, we further introduce an on-policy fine-tuning phase for the estimator
  to enhance its robustness and accuracy. The simulation results show that BAS achieves
  50% better safety in dynamic environments while maintaining a higher speed on average.
  In real-world experiments, BAS shows its capability in complex environments with
  unknown physics (e.g., slippery floors with unknown frictions, carrying up unknown
  payloads up to 8kg), while baselines lack adaptivity, leading to collisions or degraded
  agility. As a result, BAS achieves a 19.8% increase in speed and gets a 2.36 times
  lower collision rate than ABS in the real world. More detailed videos of the real-world
  performance of BAS are listed on our website: https://adaptive-safe-locomotion.github.io'
