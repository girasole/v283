title: Learning Two-agent Motion Planning Strategies from Generalized Nash Equilibrium
  for Model Predictive Control
abstract: We introduce an Implicit Game-Theoretic MPC (IGT-MPC), a decentralized algorithm
  for two-agent motion planning that uses a learned value function that predicts the
  game-theoretic interaction outcomes as the terminal cost-to-go function in a model
  predictive control (MPC) framework, guiding agents to implicitly account for interactions
  with other agents and maximize their reward. This approach applies to competitive
  and cooperative multi-agent motion planning problems which we formulate as constrained
  dynamic games. Given a constrained dynamic game, we randomly sample initial conditions
  and solve for the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) to generate a dataset of GNE
  solutions, computing the reward outcome of each game-theoretic interaction from
  the GNE. The data is used to train a simple neural network to predict the reward
  outcome, which we use as the terminal cost-to-go function in an MPC scheme. We showcase
  emerging competitive and coordinated behaviors using IGT-MPC in scenarios such as
  two-vehicle head-to-head racing and un-signalized intersection navigation. IGT-MPC
  offers a novel method integrating machine learning and game-theoretic reasoning
  into model-based decentralized multi-agent motion planning.
