title: Data-Driven Yet Formal Policy Synthesis for Stochastic Nonlinear Dynamical
  Systems
abstract: The automated synthesis of control policies for stochastic dynamical systems
  presents significant challenges. A standard approach is to construct a finite-state
  abstraction of the continuous system, typically represented as a Markov decision
  process (MDP). However, generating abstractions is challenging when (1) the systemâ€™s
  dynamics are nonlinear, and/or (2) we do not have complete knowledge of the dynamics.
  In this work, we introduce a novel data-driven abstraction technique for nonlinear
  Lipschitz continuous dynamical systems with additive stochastic noise that addresses
  both of these issues. As a key step, we use samples of the dynamics to learn the
  enabled actions and transition probabilities of the abstraction. We represent abstractions
  as MDPs with intervals of transition probabilities, known as interval MDPs (IMDPs).
  These abstractions enable the synthesis of policies for the concrete nonlinear system,
  with probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees on the probability of satisfying
  a specified control objective. Our numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness
  and robustness of our approach in achieving reliable control under uncertainty.
