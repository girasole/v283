title: QP Based Constrained Optimization for Reliable PINN Training
abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool
  for integrating physics-based constraints and data to address forward and inverse
  problems in machine learning. Despite their potential, the implementation of PINNs
  are hampered by several challenges, including issues related to convergence, stability,
  and the design of neural networks and loss functions. In this paper, we introduce
  a novel training scheme that addresses these challenges by framing the training
  process as a constrained optimization problem. Utilizing a quadratic program (QP)-based
  gradient descent law, our approach simplifies the design of loss functions and guarantees
  convergences to optimal neural network parameters. This methodology enables dynamic
  balancing, over the course of training, between data-based loss and a partial differential
  equation (PDE) residual loss, ensuring an acceptable level of accuracy while prioritizing
  the minimization of PDE-based loss. We demonstrate the formulation of the constrained
  PINNs approach with noisy data, in the context of solving Laplaceâ€™s equation in
  a capacitor with complex geometry. This work not only advances the capabilities
  of PINNs but also provides a framework for their training.
