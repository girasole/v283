title: 'Safe Exploration in Reinforcement Learning: Training Backup Control Barrier
  Functions with Zero Training-Time Safety Violations'
abstract: This paper introduces the Reinforcement Learning Backup Shield (RLBUS),
  a framework that guarantees safe exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) by incorporating
  Backup Control Barrier Functions (BCBFs). RLBUS synthesizes an implicit control
  forward invariant subset of the safe set using multiple backup policies, ensuring
  safety in the presence of input constraints. While traditional BCBFs often yield
  conservative control forward invariant sets due to the design of backup controllers,
  RLBUS addresses this limitation by leveraging model-free RL to train an additional
  backup policy, enlarging the identified forward invariant subset of the safe set.
  This approach enables safe exploration of larger regions of the state space with
  zero safety violations during training. The effectiveness of RLBUS is demonstrated
  on an inverted pendulum example, where the expanded invariant set facilitates safe
  exploration over a broader state space, enhancing performance without compromising
  safety.
