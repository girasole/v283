title: Learning for Layered Safety-Critical Control with Predictive Control Barrier
  Functions
abstract: 'Safety filters leveraging control barrier functions (CBFs) are highly effective
  for enforcing safe behavior on complex systems. It is often easier to synthesize
  these for Reduced order Models (RoMs), and then track the resulting safe control
  input on the Full order Model (FoM)â€”yet gaps between the RoM and FoM can result
  in safety violations. This paper introduces \emph{predictive CBFs} to address this
  gap: leveraging rollouts of the FoM to define a predictive robustness term added
  to the CBF condition. Theoretically, we prove that this guarantees safety in a layered
  control implementation. Practically, we learn the predictive robustness term through
  massive parallel simulation with domain randomization. We demonstrate in simulation
  that this yields safe behavior on the FoM with minimal conservatism, and experimentally
  realize predictive CBFs on a 3D hopping robot.'
