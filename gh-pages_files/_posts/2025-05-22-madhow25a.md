title: Rates for Offline Reinforcement Learning with Adaptively Collected Data
abstract: Developing theoretical guarantees on the sample complexity of offline RL
  methods is an important step towards making data-hungry RL algorithms practically
  viable. Such results tend to hinge on unrealistic assumptions about the data distribution
  â€” namely that it comprises a set of i.i.d. trajectories collected by a single logging
  policy. We propose a relaxation of the i.i.d. setting that allows logging policies
  to depend adaptively upon previous data. For tabular MDPs, we show that minimax-optimal
  bounds on the sample complexity of offline policy evaluation (OPE) and offline policy
  learning (OPL) can be recovered under this adaptive setting, and also derive instance-dependent
  bounds. Finally, we conduct simulations to empirically analyze the behavior of these
  estimators under adaptive and non-adaptive data. We find that, even while controlling
  for logging policies, adaptive data can change the signed behavior of estimation
  error.
