title: Hybrid Modeling of Heterogeneous Human Teams for Collaborative Decision Processes
abstract: The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) enabled systems
  with human operators underscores the need for seamless collaboration across various
  domains. Accurate modeling of human behavior can enable AI-enabled systems to anticipate
  human decisions and align themselves to support humans in complex tasks. Unlike
  existing methods focusing primarily on individual human behavioral modeling, this
  paper models human behavior within heterogeneous teams working toward a cooperative
  objective. In such teams, members often have varying skills, knowledge, and levels
  of awareness, which influence their decision-making processes. This paper models
  team behavior as a sub-optimal, hybrid form of multi-agent reinforcement learning.
  By leveraging centralized training with hybrid centralized/decentralized execution,
  the model captures a spectrum of team behaviors, from fully centralized to fully
  decentralized and in between. This paper quantitatively models each team memberâ€™s
  awareness and communication levels, enabling the inverse learning of these parameters
  from observed human team behavior data. Numerical experiments validate the robustness
  and accuracy of the framework across diverse scenarios and team compositions, underscoring
  its effectiveness in modeling complex human interactions.
