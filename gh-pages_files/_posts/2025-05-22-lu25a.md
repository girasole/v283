title: Safe Learning in the Real World via Adaptive Shielding with Hamilton-Jacobi
  Reachability
abstract: We present a robust shielding framework using Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability
  that can be combined with any off-policy Reinforcement Learning to enable safer
  learning. Using an approximate model of a system dynamics, our method can capture
  the local model mismatch from a safety perspective. This leads to a more conservative
  safety filter that can adapt to model mismatch. Using a Turtlebot 2, we demonstrate
  that our method can allow for safe learning in the real-world with minimal human
  intervention.
