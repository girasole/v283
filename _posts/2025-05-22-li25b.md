title: Continual Learning and Lifting of Koopman Dynamics for Linear Control of Legged
  Robots
abstract: The control of legged robots, particularly humanoid and quadruped robots,
  presents significant challenges due to their high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamics.
  While linear systems can be effectively controlled using methods like Model Predictive
  Control (MPC), the control of nonlinear systems remains complex. One promising solution
  is the Koopman Operator, which approximates nonlinear dynamics with a linear model,
  enabling the use of proven linear control techniques. However, achieving accurate
  linearization through data-driven methods is difficult due to issues like approximation
  error, domain shifts, and the limitations of fixed linear state-space representations.
  These challenges restrict the scalability of Koopman-based approaches. This paper
  addresses these challenges by proposing Incremental Koopman algorithm designed to
  iteratively refine Koopman dynamics for high-dimensional legged robots. The key
  idea is to progressively expand the dataset and latent space dimension, enabling
  the learned Koopman dynamics to converge towards accurate approximations of the
  true system dynamics. Theoretical analysis shows that the linear approximation error
  of our method converges monotonically. Experimental results demonstrate that our
  method achieves high control performance on robots like Unitree G1/H1/A1/Go2 and
  ANYmal D, across various terrains using simple linear MPC controllers. This work
  is the first to successfully apply linearized Koopman dynamics for locomotion control
  of high-dimensional legged robots, enabling a scalable model-based control solution.
