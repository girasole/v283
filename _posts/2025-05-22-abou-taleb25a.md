title: Koopman Based Trajectory Optimization with Mixed Boundaries
abstract: 'Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool in the design and control
  of dynamical systems. Typically, not only nonlinear dynamics, but also couplings
  of the initial and final condition through implicit boundary constraints render
  the optimization problem non-convex. This paper investigates how the Koopman operator
  framework can be utilized to solve trajectory optimization problems in a (partially)
  convex fashion. While the Koopman operator has already been successfully employed
  in model predictive control, the challenge of addressing mixed boundary constraints
  within the Koopman framework has remained an open question. We first address this
  issue by explaining why a complete convexification of the problem is not possible.
  Secondly, we propose a method where we transform the trajectory optimization problem
  into a bilevel problem in which we are then able to convexify the high-dimensional
  lower-level problem. This separation yields a low-dimensional upper-level problem,
  which could be exploited in global optimization algorithms. Lastly, we demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the method on two example systems: the mathematical pendulum
  and the compass-gait walker.'
