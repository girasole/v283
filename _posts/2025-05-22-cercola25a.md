title: Automating the loop in traffic incident management on highway
abstract: 'Effective traffic incident management is essential for ensuring safety,
  minimizing congestion, and reducing response times in emergency situations. Traditional
  highway incident management relies heavily on radio room operators, who must make
  rapid, informed decisions in high-stakes environments. This paper proposes an innovative
  solution to support and enhance these decisions by integrating Large Language Models
  (LLMs) into a decision-support system for traffic incident management. We introduce
  two approaches: (1) an LLM + Optimization hybrid that leverages both the flexibility
  of natural language interaction and the robustness of optimization techniques, and
  (2) a Full LLM approach that autonomously generates decisions using only LLM capabilities.
  We tested our solutions using historical event data from Autostrade per lâ€™Italia.
  Experimental results indicate that while both approaches show promise, the LLM +
  Optimization solution demonstrates superior reliability, making it particularly
  suited to critical applications where consistency and accuracy are paramount. This
  research highlights the potential for LLMs to transform highway incident management
  by enabling accessible, data-driven decision-making support.'
