title: Exploiting Approximate Symmetry for Efficient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Mean-field games (MFG) have become significant tools for solving large-scale
  multi-agent reinforcement learning problems under symmetry. However, the assumptions
  of access to a known MFG model (which might not be available for real-world games)
  and of exact symmetry (real-world scenarios often feature heterogeneity) limit the
  applicability of MFGs. In this work, we broaden the applicability of MFGs by providing
  a methodology to extend any finite-player, possibly asymmetric, game to an “induced
  MFG”. First, we prove that $N$-player dynamic games can be symmetrized and smoothly
  extended to the infinite-player continuum via Kirszbraun extensions. Next, we define
  $\alpha,\beta$-symmetric games, a new class of dynamic games that incorporate approximate
  permutation invariance. We establish explicit approximation bounds for $\alpha,\beta$-symmetric
  games, demonstrating that the induced mean-field Nash policy is an approximate Nash
  of the $N$-player game. We analyze TD learning using sample trajectories of the
  $N$-player game, permitting learning without using an explicit MFG model or oracle.
  This is used to show a sample complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-6})$
  for $N$-agent monotone extendable games to learn an $\varepsilon$-Nash. Evaluations
  on benchmarks with thousands of agents support our theory of learning under (approximate)
  symmetry without explicit MFGs.
