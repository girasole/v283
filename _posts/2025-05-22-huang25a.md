title: Toward Near-Globally Optimal Nonlinear Model Predictive Control via Diffusion
  Models
abstract: Achieving global optimality in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC)
  is challenging due to the non-convex nature of the underlying optimization problem.
  Since commonly employed local optimization techniques depend on carefully chosen
  initial guesses, this non-convexity often leads to suboptimal performance resulting
  from local optima. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion model-based
  approach for near-globally optimal NMPC consisting of an offline and an online phase.
  The offline phase employs a local optimizer to sample from the distribution of optimal
  NMPC control sequences along generated system trajectories through random initial
  guesses. Subsequently, the generated diverse dataset is used to train a diffusion
  model to reflect the multi-modal distribution of optima. In the online phase, the
  trained model is leveraged to efficiently perform a variant of random shooting optimization
  to obtain near-globally optimal control sequences without relying on any initial
  guesses or online NMPC solving. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated
  in a numerical simulation indicating high performance benefits compared to direct
  neural network approximations of NMPC and significantly lower computation times
  than online solving NMPC using global optimizers.
