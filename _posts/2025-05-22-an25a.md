title: Disentangling Uncertainties by Learning Compressed Data Representation
abstract: We study aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty estimation in a learned regressive
  system dynamics model. Disentangling aleatoric uncertainty (the inherent randomness
  of the system) from epistemic uncertainty (the lack of data) is crucial for downstream
  tasks such as risk-aware control and reinforcement learning, efficient exploration,
  and robust policy transfer. While existing approaches like Gaussian Processes, Bayesian
  networks, and model ensembles are widely adopted, they suffer from either high computational
  complexity or inaccurate uncertainty estimation. To address these limitations, we
  propose the Compressed Data Representation Model (CDRM), a framework that learns
  a neural network encoding of the data distribution and enables direct sampling from
  the output distribution. Our approach incorporates a novel inference procedure based
  on Langevin dynamics sampling, allowing CDRM to predict arbitrary output distributions
  rather than being constrained to a Gaussian prior. Theoretical analysis provides
  the conditions where CDRM achieves better memory and computational complexity compared
  to bin-based compression methods. Empirical evaluations show that CDRM demonstrates
  a superior capability to identify aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties separately,
  achieving AUROCs of 0.8876 and 0.9981 on a single test set containing a mixture
  of both uncertainties. Qualitative results further show that CDRMâ€™s capability extends
  to datasets with multimodal output distributions, a challenging scenario where existing
  methods consistently fail. Code and supplementary materials are available at \url{https://github.com/ryeii/CDRM}.
