title: Meta-Learning for Adaptive Control with Automated Mirror Descent
abstract: Adaptive control achieves concurrent parameter learning and stable control
  under uncertainties that are linearly parameterized with known nonlinear features.
  Nonetheless, it is often difficult to obtain such nonlinear features. To address
  this difficulty, recent progress has been made in integrating meta-learning with
  adaptive control to learn such nonlinear features from data. However, these meta-learning-based
  control methods rely on classical adaptation laws using gradient descent, which
  is confined to the Euclidean geometry. In this paper, we propose a novel method
  that combines meta-learning and adaptation laws based on mirror descent, a popular
  generalization of gradient descent, which takes advantage of the potentially non-Euclidean
  geometry of the parameter space. In our approach, meta-learning not only learns
  the nonlinear features but also searches for a suitable mirror-descent potential
  function that optimizes control performance. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning efficient representations and
  real-time tracking control performance under uncertain dynamics.
