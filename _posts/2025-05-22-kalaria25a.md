title: "$α$-RACER: Real-Time Algorithm for Game-Theoretic Motion Planning and Control
  in Autonomous Racing using Near-Potential Function"
abstract: 'Autonomous racing extends beyond the challenge of controlling a racecar
  at its physical limits. Professional racers employ strategic maneuvers to outwit
  other competing opponents to secure victory. While modern control algorithms can
  achieve human-level performance by computing offline racing lines for single-car
  scenarios, research on real-time algorithms for multi-car autonomous racing is limited.
  To bridge this gap, we develop game-theoretic modeling framework that incorporates
  the competitive aspect of autonomous racing like overtaking and blocking through
  a novel policy parametrization, while operating the car at its limit. Furthermore,
  we propose an algorithmic approach to compute the (approximate) Nash equilibrium
  strategy, which represents the optimal approach in the presence of competing agents.
  Specifically, we introduce an algorithm inspired by recently introduced framework
  of dynamic near-potential function, enabling real-time computation of the Nash equilibrium.
  Our approach comprises two phases: offline and online. During the offline phase,
  we use simulated racing data to learn a near-potential function that approximates
  utility changes for agents. This function facilitates the online computation of
  approximate Nash equilibria by maximizing its value. We evaluate our method in a
  head-to-head 3-car racing scenario, demonstrating superior performance compared
  to several existing baselines.'
