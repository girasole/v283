title: Learning and steering game dynamics towards desirable outcomes
abstract: Game dynamics, which describe how agents’ strategies evolve over time based
  on past interactions, can exhibit a variety of undesirable behaviours including
  convergence to suboptimal equilibria, cycling, and chaos. While central planners
  can employ incentives to mitigate such behaviors and steer game dynamics towards
  desirable outcomes, the effectiveness of such interventions critically relies on
  accurately predicting agents’ responses to these incentives—a task made particularly
  challenging when the underlying dynamics are unknown and observations are limited.
  To address this challenge, this work introduces the Side Information Assisted Regression
  with Model Predictive Control (SIAR-MPC) framework. We extend the recently introduced
  SIAR method to incorporate the effect of control, enabling it to utilize side-information
  constraints inherent to game-theoretic applications to model agents’ responses to
  incentives from scarce data. MPC then leverages this model to implement dynamic
  incentive adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SIAR-MPC
  in guiding systems towards socially optimal equilibria, stabilizing chaotic and
  cycling behaviors. Notably, it achieves these results in data-scarce settings of
  few learning samples, where well-known system identification methods paired with
  MPC show less effective results.
