title: 'Opt-ODENet: Neural ODE Controller Design with Differentiable Optimization
  Layers for Safety and Stability'
abstract: Designing controllers that achieve task objectives while ensuring safety
  is a key challenge in control systems. This work introduces Opt-ODENet, a Neural
  ODE framework with a differentiable Quadratic Programming (QP) optimization layer
  to enforce constraints as hard requirements. Eliminating the reliance on nominal
  controllers or large datasets, our framework solves the optimal control problem
  directly using Neural ODEs. Stability and convergence are ensured through Control
  Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) in the loss function, while Control Barrier Functions
  (CBFs) embedded in the QP layer enforce real-time safety. By integrating the differentiable
  QP layer with Neural ODEs, we demonstrate compatibility with the adjoint method
  for gradient computation, enabling the learning of the CBF class-$\mathcal{K}$ function
  and control network parameters. Experiments validate its effectiveness in balancing
  safety and performance.
