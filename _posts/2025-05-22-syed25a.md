title: Exploiting inter-agent coupling information for efficient reinforcement learning
  of cooperative LQR
abstract: Developing scalable and efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for
  cooperative multi-agent control has received significant attention over the past
  years. Existing literature has proposed inexact decompositions of local Q-functions
  based on empirical information structures between the agents. In this paper, we
  exploit inter-agent coupling information and propose a systematic approach to exactly
  decompose the local Q-function of each agent. We develop an approximate least square
  policy iteration algorithm based on the proposed decomposition and identify two
  architectures to learn the local Q-function for each agent. We establish that the
  worst-case sample complexity of the decomposition is equal to the centralized case
  and derive necessary and sufficient graphical conditions on the inter-agent couplings
  to achieve better sample efficiency. We demonstrate the improved sample efficiency
  and computational efficiency on numerical examples.
