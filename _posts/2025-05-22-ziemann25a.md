title: 'State space models, emergence, and ergodicity: How many parameters are needed
  for stable predictions?'
abstract: How many parameters are required for a model to execute a given task? It
  has been argued that large language models, pre-trained via self-supervised learning,
  exhibit emergent capabilities such as multi-step reasoning as their number of parameters
  reach a critical scale. In the present work, we explore whether this phenomenon
  can analogously be replicated in a simple theoretical model. We show that the problem
  of learning linear dynamical systems–a simple instance of self-supervised learning–exhibits
  a corresponding phase transition. Namely, for every non-ergodic linear system there
  exists a critical threshold such that a learner using fewer parameters than said
  threshold cannot achieve bounded error for large sequence lengths. Put differently,
  in our model we find that tasks exhibiting substantial long-range correlation require
  a certain critical number of parameters–a phenomenon akin to emergence. We also
  investigate the role of the learner’s parametrization and consider a simple version
  of a linear dynamical system with hidden state—an imperfectly observed random walk
  on the real line. For this situation, we show that there exists no learner using
  a linear filter which can successfully learn the random walk unless the filter length
  exceeds a certain threshold depending on the effective memory length and horizon
  of the problem.
