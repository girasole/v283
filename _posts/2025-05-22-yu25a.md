title: Interaction-Aware Parameter Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing in Coupled Systems
  via Particle Filter Reinforcement Learning
abstract: This paper addresses the problem of parameter privacy-preserving data sharing
  in coupled systems, where a data provider shares data with a data user but wants
  to protect its sensitive parameters. The shared data affects not only the data user’s
  decision-making but also the data provider’s operations through system interactions.
  To trade off control performance and privacy, we propose an interaction-aware privacy-preserving
  data sharing approach. Our approach generates distorted data by minimizing a combination
  of (i) mutual information that quantifies the privacy leakage of sensitive parameters
  and (ii) the impact of distorted data on the data provider’s control performance,
  considering the interactions between stakeholders. The optimization problem is formulated
  into a Bellman equation and solved by a particle filter reinforcement learning (RL)-based
  approach. Compared to existing RL-based methods, our formulation significantly reduces
  history dependency and efficiently handles scenarios with continuous state space.
  The proposed method is validated in a mixed-autonomy platoon scenario, where it
  successfully protects sensitive driving behavior parameters of human-driven vehicles
  (HDVs) against inference attacks while maintaining negligible impact on fuel efficiency.
