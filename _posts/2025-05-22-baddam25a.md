title: Data-Driven Near-Optimal Control of Nonlinear Systems Over Finite Horizon
abstract: We employ reinforcement learning to address the problem of two-point boundary
  optimal control for nonlinear systems over a finite time horizon with unknown model
  dynamics. By leveraging techniques from singular perturbation theory, we decompose
  the finite-horizon control problem into two sub-problems, each defined over an infinite
  horizon. This decomposition eliminates the need to solve the time-varying Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
  (HJB) equation, significantly simplifying the process. Using a policy iteration
  method enabled by this decomposition, we learn the controller gains for each of
  the two sub-problems. The overall control strategy is then constructed by combining
  the solutions of these sub-problems. We demonstrate that the performance of the
  proposed closed-loop system asymptotically approaches the model-based optimal performance
  as the time horizon becomes large. Finally, we validate our approach through simulation
  scenarios, which provide strong support for the claims made in this paper.
