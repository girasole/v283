title: Neural Operators for Predictor Feedback Control of Nonlinear Delay Systems
abstract: Predictor feedback designs are critical for delay-compensating controllers
  in nonlinear systems. However, these designs are limited in practical applications
  as predictors cannot be directly implemented, but require numerical approximation
  schemes, which become computationally prohibitive when system dynamics are expensive
  to compute. To address this challenge, we recast the predictor design as an operator
  learning problem, and learn the predictor mapping via a neural operator. We prove
  the existence of an arbitrarily accurate neural operator approximation of the predictor
  operator. Under the approximated predictor, we achieve semiglobal practical stability
  of the closed-loop nonlinear delay system. The estimate is semiglobal in a unique
  sense â€” one can enlarge the set of initial states as desired, though this increases
  the difficulty of training a neural operator, which appears practically in the stability
  estimate. Furthermore, our analysis holds for any black-box predictor satisfying
  the universal approximation error bound. We demonstrate the approach by controlling
  a 5-link robotic manipulator with different neural operator models, achieving significant
  speedups compared to classic predictor feedback schemes while maintaining closed-loop
  stability.
