title: Computing Quasi-Nash Equilibria via Gradient-Response Schemes
abstract: We consider a class of smooth static N-player noncooperative games, where
  player objectives are expectation-valued and potentially nonconvex. In such a setting,
  we consider the largely open question of efficiently computing a suitably defined
  quasi-Nash equilibrium (QNE) via a stochastic gradient-response framework. First,
  under a suitably defined quadratic growth property, we prove that both the stochastic
  synchronous gradient-response (SSGR) scheme and its asynchronous counterpart (SAGR)
  are characterized by almost sure convergence to a QNE and a sublinear rate guarantee.
  Notably, when a potentiality requirement is overlaid under a somewhat stronger pseudomonotonicity
  condition, this claim can be made for a Nash equilibrium (NE), rather than a QNE.
  Second, under the weak sharpness property, we show that the deterministic synchronous
  variant (SGR) displays a linear rate of convergence sufficiently close to a QNE
  by leveraging a geometric decay in steplengths. This suggests the development of
  a two-stage scheme with global non-asymptotic sublinear rates and a local linear
  rate. We also present applications satisfying the prescribed requirements where
  preliminary numerics appear promising.
