title: Symmetries-enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful framework for
  enabling agents to learn complex, coordinated behaviors but faces persistent challenges
  regarding its generalization, scalability and sample efficiency. Recent advancements
  have sought to alleviate those issues by embedding intrinsic symmetries of the systems
  in the policy. Yet, most dynamical systems exhibit little to no symmetries to exploit.
  This paper presents a novel framework for embedding extrinsic symmetries in multi-agent
  system dynamics that enables the use of symmetry-enhanced methods to address systems
  with insufficient intrinsic symmetries, expanding the scope of equivariant learning
  to a wide variety of MARL problems. Central to our framework is the Group Equivariant
  Graphormer, a group-modular architecture specifically designed for distributed swarming
  tasks. Extensive experiments on a swarm of symmetry-breaking quadrotors validate
  the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its potential for improved generalization
  and zero-shot scalability. Our method achieves significant reductions in collision
  rates and enhances task success rates across a diverse range of scenarios and varying
  swarm sizes.
