title: Abstraction-Based Control of Unknown Continuous-Space Models with Just Two
  Trajectories
abstract: Finite abstractions (a.k.a. symbolic models) offer an effective scheme for
  approximating the complex continuous-space systems with simpler models in the discrete-space
  domain. A crucial aspect, however, is to establish a formal relation between the
  original system and its symbolic model, ensuring that a discrete controller designed
  for the symbolic model can be effectively implemented as a hybrid controller (using
  an interface map) for the original system. This task becomes even more challenging
  when the exact mathematical model of the continuous-space system is unknown. To
  address this, the existing literature mainly employs scenario-based data-driven
  methods, which require collecting a large amount of data from the original system.
  In this work, we propose a data-driven framework that utilizes only two input-state
  trajectories collected from unknown nonlinear polynomial systems to synthesize a
  hybrid controller, enabling the desired behavior on the unknown system through the
  controller derived from its symbolic model. To accomplish this, we employ the concept
  of alternating simulation functions (ASFs) to quantify the closeness between the
  state trajectories of the unknown system and its data-driven symbolic model. By
  satisfying a specific rank condition on the collected data, which intuitively ensures
  that the unknown system is persistently excited, we directly design an ASF and its
  corresponding hybrid controller using finite-length data without explicitly identifying
  the unknown system, while providing correctness guarantees. This is achieved through
  proposing a data-based sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program, enabling a systematic
  approach to the design process. We illustrate the effectiveness of our data-driven
  approach through a case study.
