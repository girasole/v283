title: Nonconvex Linear System Identification with Minimal State Representation
abstract: Low-order linear System IDentification (SysID) addresses the challenge of
  estimating the parameters of a linear dynamical system from finite samples of observations
  and control inputs with minimal state representation. Traditional approaches often
  utilize Hankel-rank minimization, which relies on convex relaxations that can require
  numerous, costly singular value decompositions (SVDs) to optimize. In this work,
  we propose two nonconvex reformulations to tackle low-order SysID (i) Burer-Monterio
  (BM) factorization of the Hankel matrix for efficient nuclear norm minimization,
  and (ii) optimizing directly over system parameters for real, diagonalizable systems
  with an atomic norm style decomposition. These reformulations circumvent the need
  for repeated heavy SVD computations, significantly improving computational efficiency.
  Moreover, we prove that optimizing directly over the system parameters yields lower
  statistical error rates, and lower sample complexities that do not scale linearly
  with trajectory length like in Hankel-nuclear norm minimization. Additionally, while
  our proposed formulations are nonconvex, we provide theoretical guarantees of achieving
  global optimality in polynomial time. Finally, we demonstrate algorithms that solve
  these nonconvex programs and validate our theoretical claims on synthetic data.
