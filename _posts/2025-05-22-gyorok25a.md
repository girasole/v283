title: Orthogonal projection-based regularization for efficient model augmentation
abstract: Deep-learning-based nonlinear system identification has shown the ability
  to produce reliable and highly accurate models in practice. However, these black-box
  models lack physical interpretability, and a considerable part of the learning effort
  is often spent on capturing already expected/known behavior of the system, that
  can be accurately described by first-principles laws of physics. A potential solution
  is to directly integrate such prior physical knowledge into the model structure,
  combining the strengths of physics-based modeling and deep-learning-based identification.
  The most common approach is to use an additive model augmentation structure, where
  the physics-based and the machine-learning (ML) components are connected in parallel,
  i.e., additively. However, such models are overparametrized, training them is challenging,
  potentially causing the physics-based part to lose interpretability. To overcome
  this challenge, this paper proposes an orthogonal projection-based regularization
  technique to enhance parameter learning and even model accuracy in learning-based
  augmentation of nonlinear baseline models.
