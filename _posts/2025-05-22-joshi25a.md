title: Interacting Particle Systems for Fast Linear Quadratic RL
abstract: This paper is concerned with the design of algorithms based on systems of
  interacting particles to represent, approximate, and learn the optimal control law
  for reinforcement learning (RL). The primary contribution is that convergence rates
  are greatly accelerated by the interactions between particles. The focus is on the
  linear quadratic stochastic optimal control problem for which a complete and novel
  theory is presented. Apart from the new algorithm, sample complexity bounds are
  obtained, and it is shown that the mean square error scales as $1/N$ where $N$ is
  the number of particles. The theoretical results and algorithms are illustrated
  with numerical experiments and comparisons with other recent approaches, where the
  faster convergence of the proposed algorithm is numerically demonstrated.
