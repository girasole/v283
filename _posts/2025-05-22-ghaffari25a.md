title: Multi-agent Stochastic Bandits Robust to Adversarial Corruptions
abstract: We study cooperative multi-agent multi-armed bandits with adversarial corruption
  in a heterogeneous setting, where each agent has access to a subset of the full
  arm set, and the adversary can corrupt the reward observations for all agents. The
  objective is to maximize the cumulative total reward of all agents (and not be misled
  by the adversary). We propose a multi-agent cooperative learning algorithm that
  is robust to adversarial corruption. For this newly devised algorithm, we demonstrate
  that an adversary with an unknown corruption budget $C$ only incurs an additive
  $O((L / L_{\min}) C)$ term to the standard regret of the model in non-corruption
  settings, where $L$ is the total number of agents, and $L_{\min}$ is the minimum
  number of agents with mutual access to an arm. As independent side contributions,
  our algorithm improves the state-of-the-art regret bounds when reducing to both
  the single-agent and homogeneous multi-agent scenarios, tightening multiplicative
  $K$ (the number of arms) and $L$ (the number of agents) factors, respectively. Lastly,
  we conduct numerical simulations to corroborate the superiority of our proposed
  algorithm.
