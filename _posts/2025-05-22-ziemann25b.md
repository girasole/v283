title: A Short Information-Theoretic Analysis of Linear Auto-Regressive Learning
abstract: In this note, we give a short information-theoretic proof of the consistency
  of the Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator in linear auto-regressive models. Our
  proof yields nearly optimal non-asymptotic rates for parameter recovery and works
  without any invocation of stability in the case of finite hypothesis classes.
