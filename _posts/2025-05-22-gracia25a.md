title: Temporal Logic Control for Nonlinear Stochastic Systems Under Unknown Disturbances
abstract: 'In this paper, we present a novel framework to synthesize robust strategies
  for discrete-time non-linear systems with and random disturbances that are unknown
  and non-additive, against temporal logic specifications. The proposed framework
  is data-driven and abstraction-based: leveraging observations of the system, our
  approach learns a high-confidence abstraction of the system in the form of an uncertain
  Markov decision process (UMDP). The uncertainty in the resulting UMDP is used to
  formally account for both the error in abstracting the system and for the uncertainty
  coming from the data. Critically, we show that for any given state-action pair in
  the resulting UMDP, the uncertainty in the transition probabilities can be represented
  as a convex polytope obtained by a 2-layer state discretization and concentration
  inequalities. This allows us to obtain tighter uncertainty estimates compared to
  existing approaches, and guarantees efficiency, as we tailor a synthesis algorithm
  exploiting the structure of this UMDP. We empirically validate our approach on several
  case studies, showing substantially improved empirical performance compared to the
  state-of-the-art.'
