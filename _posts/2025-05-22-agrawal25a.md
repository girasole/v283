title: Conditional Kernel Imitation Learning for Continuous State Environments
abstract: 'Imitation Learning (IL) is an important paradigm within the broader reinforcement
  learning (RL) methodology. Unlike most of RL, it does not assume availability of
  reward-feedback. Classical methods such as behavioral cloning and inverse reinforcement
  learning are highly sensitive to estimation errors, especially in continuous state
  space problems. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art (SOTA) IL algorithms often require additional
  online interaction data to be effective. In this paper, we consider the problem
  of imitation learning in continuous state space environments based solely on observed
  behavior, without access to transition dynamics information, reward structure, or,
  most importantly, any additional interactions with the environment. Our approach
  is based on the Markov balance equation and introduces a novel conditional kernel
  density estimation-based imitation learning framework. It uses conditional kernel
  density estimators for transition dynamics and seeks to satisfy a balance equation
  for the environment. We establish that our estimators satisfy asymptotic consistency
  and present associated sample complexity analysis. Through a series of numerical
  experiments on continuous state benchmark environments, we show consistently superior
  empirical performance over many SOTA IL algorithms. The full paper with the appendix
  is available at: https://github.com/rishabh-1086/CKIL.'
