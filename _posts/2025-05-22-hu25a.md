title: Safe PDE Boundary Control with Neural Operators
abstract: The physical world dynamics are generally governed by underlying partial
  differential equations (PDEs) with unknown analytical forms in science and engineering
  problems. Neural network based data-driven approaches have been heavily studied
  in simulating and solving PDE problems in recent years, but it is still challenging
  to move forward from understanding to controlling the unknown PDE dynamics. PDE
  boundary control instantiates a simplified but important problem by only focusing
  on PDE boundary conditions as the control input and output. However, current model-free
  PDE controllers cannot ensure that the boundary output satisfies some given user-specified
  safety constraint. To this end, we propose a safety filtering framework to guarantee
  the boundary output stays within the safe set for current model-free controllers.
  Specifically, we first introduce a neural boundary control barrier function (BCBF)
  to ensure the feasibility of the trajectory-wise constraint satisfaction of boundary
  output. Based on the neural operator modeling the transfer function from boundary
  control input to output trajectories, we show that the change in the BCBF depends
  linearly on the change in input boundary, so quadratic programming-based safety
  filtering can be done for pre-trained model-free controllers. Extensive experiments
  under challenging hyperbolic, parabolic and Navier-Stokes PDE dynamics environments
  validate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving better
  general performance and boundary constraint satisfaction compared to the vanilla
  and constrained model-free controller baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/intelligent-control-lab/safe-pde-control.
