title: 'BIGE : Biomechanics-informed GenAI for Exercise Science'
abstract: Proper movements enhance mobility, coordination, and muscle activation,
  which are crucial for performance, injury prevention, and overall fitness. However,
  traditional simulation tools rely on strong modeling assumptions, are difficult
  to set up and computationally expensive. On the other hand, generative AI approaches
  provide efficient alternatives to motion generation. But they often lack physiological
  relevance and do not incorporate biomechanical constraints, limiting their practical
  applications in sports and exercise science. To address these limitations, we propose
  a novel framework, BIGE, that combines bio-mechanically meaningful scoring metrics
  with generative modeling. BIGE integrates a differentiable surrogate model for muscle
  activation to reverse optimize the latent space of the generative model, enabling
  the retrieval of physiologically valid motions through targeted search. Through
  extensive experiments on squat exercise data, our framework demonstrates superior
  performance in generating diverse, physically plausible motions while maintaining
  high fidelity to clinician-defined objectives compared to existing approaches.
