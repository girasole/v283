title: Reinforcement Learning from Multi-level and Episodic Human Feedback
abstract: Designing an effective reward function has long been a challenge in reinforcement
  learning, particularly for complex tasks in unstructured environments. To address
  this, various learning paradigms have emerged that leverage different forms of human
  input to specify or refine the reward function. Reinforcement learning from human
  feedback is a prominent approach that utilizes human comparative feedback—expressed
  as a preference for one behavior over another—to tackle this problem. In contrast
  to comparative feedback, we explore multi-level human feedback, which is provided
  in the form of a score at the end of each episode. This type of feedback offers
  more coarse but informative signals about the underlying reward function than binary
  feedback. Additionally, it can handle non-Markovian rewards, as it is based on an
  entire episode’s evaluation. We propose an algorithm to efficiently learn both the
  reward function and the optimal policy from this form of feedback. Moreover, we
  show that the proposed algorithm achieves sublinear regret and demonstrate its empirical
  effectiveness through extensive simulations.
