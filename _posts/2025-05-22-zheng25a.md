title: Extended Convex Lifting for Policy Optimization of Optimal and Robust Control
abstract: Many optimal and robust control problems are nonconvex and potentially nonsmooth
  in their policy optimization forms. In this paper, we introduce the Extended Convex
  Lifting (ECL) framework, which reveals hidden convexity in classical optimal and
  robust control problems from a modern optimization perspective. Our ECL framework
  offers a bridge between nonconvex policy optimization and convex reformulations.
  Despite non-convexity and non-smoothness, the existence of an ECL for policy optimization
  not only reveals that the policy optimization problem is equivalent to a convex
  problem, but also certifies a class of first-order non-degenerate stationary points
  to be globally optimal. We further show that this ECL framework encompasses many
  benchmark control problems, including LQR, state-feedback and output-feedback H-infinity
  robust control. We believe that ECL will also be of independent interest for analyzing
  nonconvex problems beyond control.
