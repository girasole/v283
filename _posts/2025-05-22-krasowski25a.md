title: Learning Biomolecular Models using Signal Temporal Logic
abstract: Modeling dynamical biological systems is key for understanding, predicting,
  and controlling complex biological behaviors. Traditional methods for identifying
  governing equations, such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs), typically require
  extensive quantitative data, which is often scarce in biological systems due to
  experimental limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach that
  determines biomolecular models from qualitative system behaviors expressed as Signal
  Temporal Logic (STL) statements, which are naturally suited to translate expert
  knowledge into computationally tractable specifications. Our method represents the
  biological network as a graph, where edges represent interactions between species,
  and uses a genetic algorithm to identify the graph. To infer the parameters of the
  ODEs modeling the interactions, we propose a gradient-based algorithm. On a numerical
  example, we evaluate two loss functions using STL robustness and analyze different
  initialization techniques to improve the convergence of the approach.
