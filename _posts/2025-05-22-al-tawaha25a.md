title: A Dynamic Penalization Framework for Online Rank-1 Semidefinite Programming
  Relaxations
abstract: 'We propose a dynamic penalization framework for recovering rank-1 solutions
  in sequential semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. Obtaining rank-1 solutions–crucial
  for recovering physically meaningful solutions in many applications–becomes particularly
  challenging in dynamic environments where problem parameters continuously evolve.
  Our framework operates in two interconnected phases: the learning phase dynamically
  adjusts penalty parameters to enforce rank-1 feasibility based on feedback from
  the decision phase, while the decision phase solves the resulting penalized SDP
  relaxations using the penalty parameters specified by the learning phase. To accelerate
  rank-1 recovery across sequential problems, we introduce a meta-learning model that
  provides informed initializations for the penalty matrices. The meta-learning model
  leverages historical data from previously solved tasks, eliminating the need for
  externally curated datasets. By using task-specific features and updates from prior
  iterations, the meta-model intelligently initializes penalty parameters, reducing
  the number of iterations required between the two phases. We prove sublinear convergence
  to rank-1 solutions and establish low dynamic regret bounds that improve with task
  similarity. Empirical results on real-world rank-constrained applications, including
  the Max-Cut problem and Optimal Power Flow (OPF), demonstrate that our method consistently
  recovers rank-1 solutions.'
