title: Mission-driven Exploration for Accelerated Deep Reinforcement Learning with
  Temporal Logic Task Specifications
abstract: This paper addresses the problem of designing control policies for agents
  with unknown stochastic dynamics and control objectives specified using Linear Temporal
  Logic (LTL). Recent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have aimed to compute
  policies that maximize the satisfaction probability of LTL formulas, but they often
  suffer from slow learning performance. To address this, we introduce a novel Deep
  Q-learning algorithm that significantly improves learning speed. The enhanced sample
  efficiency stems from a mission-driven exploration strategy that prioritizes exploration
  towards directions likely to contribute to mission success. Identifying these directions
  relies on an automaton representation of the LTL task as well as a learned neural
  network that partially models the agent-environment interaction. We provide comparative
  experiments demonstrating the efficiency of our algorithm on robot navigation tasks
  in unseen environments.
