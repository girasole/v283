title: 'WAVE: Wasserstein Adaptive Value Estimation for Actor-Critic Reinforcement
  Learning'
abstract: We present WAVE (Wasserstein Adaptive Value Estimation for Actor-Critic),
  an approach to enhance stability in deep reinforcement learning through adaptive
  Wasserstein regularization. Our method addresses the inherent instability of actor-critic
  algorithms by incorporating an adaptively weighted Wasserstein regularization term
  into the critic’s loss function. We prove that WAVE achieves $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$
  convergence rate for the critic’s mean squared error and provide theoretical guarantees
  for stability through Wasserstein-based regularization. Using the Sinkhorn approximation
  for computational efficiency, our approach automatically adjusts the regularization
  based on the agent’s performance. Theoretical analysis and experimental results
  demonstrate that WAVE achieves superior performance compared to standard actor-critic
  methods.
