title: Linear System Identification from Snapshot Data by Schrodinger bridge
abstract: This paper proposes a system identification method for linear Gaussian systems
  from snapshot measurement data using Schrodinger bridges (SB). In many practical
  applications, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, only snapshot measurements of
  system state are available, making traditional system identification challenging.
  Our method employs an EM-like algorithm that alternates between trajectory estimation
  using SB and system parameter inference from the estimated trajectories. The Gaussian
  assumption for system states and noise allows us to exploit analytical solutions
  for the SB computation and parameter updates, enabling efficient computation. We
  also propose a data-driven method for estimating linear Gaussian SB, where marginal
  parameters are estimated incorporating dynamic constraints. In numerical simulation,
  we show our method achieves superior identification accuracy and time efficiency.
