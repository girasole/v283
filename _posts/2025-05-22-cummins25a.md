title: Controlling Participation in Federated Learning with Feedback
abstract: We address the problem of client participation in federated learning, where
  traditional methods typically rely on a random selection of a small subset of clients
  for each training round. In contrast, we propose FedBack, a deterministic approach
  that leverages control-theoretic principles to manage client participation in ADMM-based
  federated learning. FedBack models client participation as a discrete-time dynamical
  system and employs an integral feedback controller to adjust each client’s participation
  rate individually, based on the client’s optimization dynamics. We provide global
  convergence guarantees for our approach by building on the recent federated learning
  research. Numerical experiments on federated image classification demonstrate that
  FedBack achieves up to 50% improvement in communication and computational efficiency
  over algorithms that rely on a random selection of clients.
