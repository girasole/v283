title: 'NAPI-MPC: Neural Accelerated Physics-Informed MPC for Nonlinear PDE Systems'
abstract: 'The control of systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations
  (PDEs) can present substantial challenges for traditional linear model predictive
  control (MPC) approaches. Data-driven MPC has emerged as a solution for dealing
  with unknown nonlinear dynamics, but issues regarding safety guarantees, accuracy,
  and data efficiency remain a concern. We propose NAPI-MPC: a novel physics-informed
  scenario-based MPC approach for control of nonlinear PDE systems with partially
  unknown dynamics. Unlike other physics-informed learning methods that require extensive
  knowledge on the governing equations, our NAPI-MPC leverages distributed Port-Hamiltonian
  systems as a generalized, energy-based representation of the PDE dynamics, in which
  the Hamiltonian is modeled and learned by a Gaussian process. The Bayesian nature
  of the Gaussian process enables the drawing of scenario samples that are used in
  scenario-based predictive control to determine the optimal control action for the
  PDE system. To ensure applicability in time-sensitive contexts, we leverage a neural
  network as proxy for the MPC controller, trained offline on states and optimal control
  actions to enable fast inference for real-time operation.'
