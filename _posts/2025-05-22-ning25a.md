title: 'DKMGP: A Gaussian Process Approach to Multi-Task and Multi-Step Vehicle Dynamics
  Modeling in Autonomous Racing'
abstract: Autonomous racing is gaining attention for its potential to advance autonomous
  vehicle technologies. Accurate race car dynamics modeling is essential for capturing
  and predicting future states like position, orientation, and velocity. However,
  accurately modeling complex subsystems such as tires and suspension poses significant
  challenges. In this paper, we introduce the Deep Kernel-based Multi-task Gaussian
  Process (DKMGP), which leverages the structure of a variational multi-task and multi-step
  Gaussian process model enhanced with deep kernel learning for vehicle dynamics modeling.
  Unlike existing single-step methods, DKMGP performs multi-step corrections with
  an adaptive correction horizon (ACH) algorithm that dynamically adjusts to varying
  driving conditions. To validate and evaluate the proposed DKMGP method, we compare
  the model performance with DKL-SKIP and a well-tuned single-track model, using high-speed
  dynamics data (exceeding 230 km/h) collected from a full-scale Indy race car during
  the Indy Autonomous Challenge held at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway at CES 2024.
  The results demonstrate that DKMGP achieves upto 99% prediction accuracy compared
  to one-step DKL-SKIP, while improving real-time computational efficiency by 1752x.
  Our results show that DKMGP is a scalable and efficient solution for vehicle dynamics
  modeling making it suitable for high-speed autonomous racing control.
