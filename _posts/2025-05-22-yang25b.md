title: Zero-shot Sim-to-Real Transfer for Reinforcement Learning-based Visual Servoing
  of Soft Continuum Arms
abstract: Soft continuum arms (SCAs) soft and deformable nature presents challenges
  in modeling and control due to their infinite degrees of freedom and non-linear
  behavior. This work introduces a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for
  visual servoing tasks on SCAs with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer capabilities,
  demonstrated on a single section pneumatic manipulator capable of bending and twisting.
  The framework decouples kinematics from mechanical properties using an RL kinematic
  controller for motion planning and a local controller for actuation refinement,
  leveraging minimal sensing with visual feedback. Trained entirely in simulation,
  the RL controller achieved a 99.8% success rate. When deployed on hardware, it achieved
  a 67% success rate in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, demonstrating robustness and
  adaptability. This approach offers a scalable solution for SCAs in 3D visual servoing,
  with potential for further refinement and expanded applications.
