title: Physics-Enforced Reservoir Computing for Forecasting Spatiotemporal Systems
abstract: 'We present a new approach for incorporating hard physical constraints into
  reservoir computing (RC). The goal of this work is to increase the reliability,
  trustworthiness, and generalizability of RC by guaranteeing adherence to known physical
  laws, particularly while simulating high dimensional systems such as spatiotemporal
  fluid flows. A reservoir is commonly implemented as a single-layer recurrent neural
  network in which only the linear output layer is trained and all other parameters
  are randomly initialized and fixed. Therefore, training a reservoir only involves
  solving a least squares problem for the weights of the final layer, posing an excellent
  opportunity to analytically enforce hard constraints. We show that physical constraints,
  such as conservation laws and boundary conditions, can be imposed in the training
  procedure and can be guaranteed to hold for forecasting. We introduce physics enforced
  reservoir computing (PERC) in which the RC training procedure is augmented with
  a linear homogeneous constraint defined by a linear operator. We then demonstrate
  this method by enforcing conserved quantities in the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system
  and zero-divergence constraints (mass conservation) in the Kolmogorov flow. In both
  cases, we enforce these constraints to near machine precision. We provide our code
