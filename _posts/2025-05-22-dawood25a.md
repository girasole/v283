title: A Dynamic Safety Shield for Safe and Efficient Reinforcement Learning of Navigation
  Tasks
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to a variety of
  robotics applications, where it outperforms classical methods. However, the safety
  aspect of RL and the transfer to the real world remain an open challenge. A prominent
  field for tackling this challenge and ensuring the safety of the agents during training
  and execution is safe reinforcement learning. Safe RL can be achieved through constrained
  RL and safe exploration approaches. The former learns the safety constraints over
  the course of training to achieve a safe behavior by the end of training, at the
  cost of high number of collisions at earlier stages of the training. The latter
  offers robust safety by enforcing the safety constraints as hard constraints, which
  prevents collisions but hinders the exploration of the RL agent, resulting in lower
  rewards and poor performance. To overcome those drawbacks, we propose a novel safety
  shield, that combines the robustness of the optimization-based controllers with
  the long prediction capabilities of the RL agents, allowing the RL agent to adaptively
  tune the parameters of the controller. Our approach is able to improve the exploration
  of the RL agents for navigation tasks, while minimizing the number of collisions.
  Experiments in simulation show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
  in the reached goals-to-collisions ratio in different challenging environments.
  The goals-to-collisions ratio metrics emphasizes the importance of minimizing the
  number of collisions, while learning to accomplish the task. Our approach achieves
  a higher number of reached goals compared to the classic safety shields and fewer
  collisions compared to constrained RL approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the performance
  of the proposed method in a real-world experiment.
