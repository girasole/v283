title: Morphological-Symmetry-Equivariant Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Robotic
  Dynamics Learning
abstract: We propose MS-HGNN, a Morphological-Symmetry-Equivariant Heterogeneous Graph
  Neural Network for robotic dynamics learning, which integrates robotic kinematic
  structures and morphological symmetries into a unified graph network. By embedding
  these structural priors as inductive biases, MS-HGNN ensures high generalizability,
  sample and model efficiency. This architecture is versatile and broadly applicable
  to various multi-body dynamic systems and dynamics learning tasks. We prove the
  morphological-symmetry-equivariant property of MS-HGNN and demonstrate its effectiveness
  across multiple quadruped robot dynamics learning problems using real-world and
  simulated data. Our code is available at https://github.com/lunarlab-gatech/MorphSym-HGNN/.
