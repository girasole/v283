title: Safe Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation
abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown significant
  promise in dynamic control environments, where effective communication and tailored
  exploration strategies facilitate collaboration. However, ensuring safe exploration
  remains challenging, as even a single unsafe action from any agent can lead to severe
  consequences. To mitigate this risk, we introduce Scoop-LSVI, a UCB-based cooperative
  parallel RL framework that achieves low cumulative regret with minimal communication
  demands while adhering to safety constraints. This framework enables multiple agents
  to concurrently solve isolated Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and share information
  to enhance learning efficiency. Scoop-LSVI attains a regret of $\Tilde{O}(\kappa
  d^{3/2} H^2 \sqrt{MK})$, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ is the horizon
  length, $M$ is the number of agents, $K$ is the number of episodes for each agent,
  and $\kappa$ represents safety constraints. This result aligns with state-of-the-art
  findings for unsafe cooperative MARL and also matches the regret bounds of UCB-based
  single-agent RL algorithms ($M = 1$), highlighting the potential of Scoop-LSVI to
  support safe and efficient learning in cooperative MARL applications.
